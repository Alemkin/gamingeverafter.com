Frain began to blink his eyes and looked up into the sunlight dappling his skin through the leaves up above. He squinted his eyes, then peered closer at the bark, noticing that it was made of peanut brittle. Confused he looked around and noticed the flowers on the ground were marshmallows, and there was the distinct smell of chocolate on the air. 

Rushing towards the source of the smell, he came upon a chocolate river. Eyes alight with delight, he began grabbing marshmallow flowers and dipping them into the chocolate river, gorging himself on the sweets. He blinked, then found himself in a sea of pure white, unable to perceive anything all around him. 

Frain blinked again and found himself in darkness, realizing that his eyes were closed. Opening them slowly, he looked around blearily, realizing that he was suckling on the edge of a large, fluffy, feather pillow. Groaning he rolled around, also realizing he was on one of the most comfortable beds he’d ever experienced, alone. Definitely not the Hard Journey Inn.

Frain rolled out of bed and stumbled around for a minute before opening the door to the room and looking out. He realized he must be in the palace, as the halls outside were pure white marble and beautiful purple crystals.  He wandered out, determined to find his way to the others.

Steph, Dom, and Tzaad awoke on the hard floor of the throne room. Steph, looking around noticed Princess Dandelion sitting on the throne up the steps, looking down at them with a smirk and stroking the fur of Waffle next to her, who was yawning. 

Giggling, the princess waved her hand and a shiny and reflective circular mirror appeared in between them, showing them all an image on Frain wandering the halls of the palace.

“I was curious to know if dwarves were as dumb as they said!” the princess barked out.

Clearing her throat Steph replied, “He may be dumb, but he’s our dumb dwarf. Do you think we could have him back?”

“Steph? Guys?”, Frain called out, looking around in the hallways, having heard them talking about him. 

Giggling, Princess Dandelion sighed, “Okay, fine”, and waved her hand, opening a door next to Frain.

Frain looked around and walked through into darkness without looking and began to fall into an infinite void. Screaming, he held his arms out in front of him, sure he was about to meet his death. Frain felt solid floor beneath his feet a moment later, and opened his eyes cautiously, still screaming, and saw everyone staring at him confused. Frain stopped suddenly and stood up straight, straightening his clothes. 

“Well, that was certainly amusing”, the princess began, “But down to business, I have the first job I need you to do for me.”

“I need you to complete a few quests for me in preparation for a feast tonight. Do this and I will consider you well within my favor!” Princess Dandelion projected, sweeping her arms regally back and forth.

“Would you not think that we are already in your favor, princess?” Steph asked boldly, stepping forward.

Fire blazing in her eyes, the princess sat forward and spat, “What have you done to gain my favor exactly!? This is what I want you to do!”.

Steph took a step back, flicking a look back at her companions then back at the princess. She nodded and waited for the princess to continue.

“Sitting back satisfied, the princess continued, “Now, I need you to retrieve my royal slippers from the cobbler of the name Frendamus. I need them tonight to prepare. You’ll know him when you see him, he is a little, nervous, fidgety little thing. Very cute for a gnome.”

The princess giggled and called out, “Sagh!”.

After a minute or so Sagh came through the doorway next to the throne, a bit out of breath and looked around.

“I really wish you would tell me when they would be here, princess!”, Sagh panted out. 

Shaking her head, Sagh beckoned for them to follow and led them down some corridors to another doorway.

Sighing she turned towards them and said, “I know this is strange, but just hang in there, and remember to be careful out there and don’t make any deals. It’s bad enough dealing with the… princess”.

Sagh said the last word in a whisper, looking back over her shoulder towards the way they came.

“Anyways, just out here, go to the right and you’ll run into the shop. Sorry I can’t be more help right now, but I have something I really need to do. I promise the end of this is not far.”, Sagh said, and opened the door into the Hedge Grove for the party, who walked out, a little tired of being jerked around by an immortal Arch Fae. 

Avoid eye contact with each other they trudged up until they came to a sign that read, “Frendamus’s Feety Slippy Things Inc.”, on a small wooden sign above a door that was slightly ajar.

Frain stepped forward, inspecting the door and noticed the lock seemed to be eaten away by an acid of some sort. Reaching out, he pushed the door open and saw a mess inside. Shelves and dressers of shoes knocked onto the floor, and a small gnome in the back of the shop, rocking back an forth in the fetal position, crying softly.

Steph and Tzaad stepped in ahead of the others, and as Steph looked around, Tzaad strode straight up to the gnome.

“You! What’s your name? And where are the shoes!?” Tzaad demanded with a stink eye directed straight at the gnome on the floor.

Looking up and seeing this huge human suddenly looming over him, the true gnome squeaked and scrabbled back, holding his hands in front of him, trying to fend him off. 

Steph stepped forward quickly and pulled Tzaad back by the shoulder, giving him a dirty look and going up to the gnome.

“Hey, it’s okay, we’re not going to hurt you”, Steph said, “Are you Frendamus?”, Steph asked.

The gnome looked up with hope and nodded slightly.

Tzaad sighed and walked over, squatting down and looking at Frendamus and said, “Hey buddy, sorry about a moment ago. We just want to help. What happened here?”

“No… Nothing”, Frendamus stammered out, trying to look like he knew what he was doing. 

Dom stepped in, pushing Tzaad aside, and yelled, “Enough of this, where are the slippers? We don’t have all day!”.

Frendamus threw up his arms again and cowered, obviously not reacting well to all the yelling.

Steph pushed Dom away, looking at him angrily, “Come on, stop it! He’s obviously terrified and yelling at him isn’t helping!”

Looking back at Frendamus, she calmed him down and was able to get him to talk.

“Pl… Please. You have to understand, it won’t end well for me if the princess found out someone stole the slippers!”, Frendamus stammered out, pointing at his workbench where they were.

Dom strode over to the workbench and began to investigate, not able to perceive anything, getting frustrated that the answer wasn’t just coming to him. Something seemed to be eating away at him, but the others weren’t sure what it was.

Steph connected with Waffle as she sniffed around. Waffle perked up as she caught a magical scent on the floor.

“What? What is it?”, Dom asked when he saw Steph look surprised.

“It’s a magical trail, she smells it!” Steph replied.

Dom nodded and closed his eyes, recalling his training with Soren and smiling slightly, recalling one of the few times he felt like he belonged as lightning crackled around his finger and he felt the presence of magical auras surround him. Opening his eyes again, he looked around a noticed a trail of footsteps lit up by magical aura, cascading around the room then finally out of the doorway.

“I see it, follow me guys!” Dom called out and strode out, with everyone else in tow.

Dom follow the trail for a bit, passing some crowds of Fae, miscellaneous shops and homes, and a group of royal Fae pushing around some nymphs and laughing. Everyone decided to ignore them, but Tzaad looked back with a sad look on his face, then turned away as they continued following the trail.

Dom stopped suddenly looking around, “The tracks stop here for some reason”.

Frain looked up and saw the nearest shop with a sign that read, “Ridacio’s Apothecary”, and pointed it out, suggesting they should ask some questions.

Stepping into the shop, the group saw shelves lined with bottles of potions of all sizes and colors, and at a desk in the back of a shop facing them was a true elf, with a pointed hat tilted backwards, looking down at a set of ledger, writing notes and referencing a set of receipts.

Looking up and smiling, the true elf stood and called out, “Welcome to my shop of potions! I am Ridacio, the potion master!”

He said this with an extra emphasis on a rolling R and flourished his hand, bowing towards them and stepped forward to Tzaad, who stood nearest.

“How can I help you today?”, Ridacio asked.

“Ah, um, actually I have a question if you don’t mind. There is a feast that the princess is holding soon, and I was wondering if you are going and what you’re going to wear, and what we should wear.” Tzaad asked him.

Ridacio looked taken aback for a moment then regained his composure replying, “Ah yes, the feast. I wouldn’t’ miss it of course! As for what I would wear, well, my best of course. As for you, there will be garb for all occasions. Dueling, sleeping, Knights regalia, etcetera. It all depends on what you are trying to communicate with the others!”

Steph stepped forward holding up her hand, “Would you mind if we saw you in your best? Just so we can understand what that means.”

Ridacio clapped his hands and rushed into a back room, before appearing again a few minutes later. He was resplendent in a royal purple suit with puffy shoulders, black buckled dress shoes, and a black pointed hat leaning backwards. He held out his arms and twirled.

“Well, what do you think!?” Ridacio asked.

Steph clapped her hands, “It’s delightful!”

Tzaad eyed his shoes, trying to figure out if these were the princesses slippers, but then shook his head and looked up at Ridacio.

“How about some acids, do you have any of those that I might be able to look at?”, Tzaad asked.

Ridacio nods and goes to his desk, picking up a small chest that clanked as he walked back over.

He opened it and flourished his hand, point them out. “This pink one here will turn your urine to acid as it interacts with the air!”

“Ahem, I was thinking of maybe something a little simpler, just for melting things”, Tzaad said.

Ridacio nodded and pulled out a light blue vial, “This with do it, it’ll eat away anything up to wood. It’s only 5 gold on special today!”

Tzaad looked delighted and pulled out 5 gold, putting away the acid for a rainy day.

“Sorry to interrupt, but I was wondering how popular these are? Has anyone bought any recently?”, Steph asked.

Ridacio thought for a moment, “Not terribly popular I’m afraid. As for buying it, a few have this past week. In fact, I saw one of those customers pass by just a few hours ago! A porcelain skinned true elf wearing dark cloak, almost prancing by as if in dance. It was very odd!”

“Which way did she go?”, Dom asked, stepping forward.

“Well, the maze shifted a bit so, you’ll have to go that way”, Ridacio replied, pointing out and back the way they had come.

“Thanks.”, Dom replied tersely and stepped out and began that way until they picked up the trail again. 

They followed Dom for a bit longer in tense silence until he stopped suddenly again near a dilapidated door, and he pointed, “The trail ends here”.

“Here we go”, Tzaad said, stepping forward and pulling out his sword and his shield, Hard Pass.

Tzaad tiptoed in ridiculous fashion, like the pink panther, rolling very badly on a stealth check, and opened the door normally. Looking in, he saw what looked like a warehouse, with boxes and shelves all out of use, and large space in the middle of the area with what looked to be a true elf with a dark cloak on and beautiful slippers dancing her heart out.

Looking closer he noticed she had an exhausted and terrified look on her face.

Noticing them the elf cried out, “Please, oh thank the gods! You need to help me, I’ve been… dancing… for hours.” The elf panted out in between hops and twirls.

Steph stepped in and crossed her arms, “What’s your name, and where did you get those shoes?”

“I’ll tell you all of it if you help me out!”, the elf replied.

“No, now.”, Steph demanded.

“Okay, I put a curse on them hoping to slip in and out and the princess would wear them and she would dance forever, but the shoes made me put them on. Please! And my name is Lydia!”, she yelled out in explanation. 

Tzaad nodded and strapped his weapons on his back, sprinting forward and tackling Lydia, rolling opposing strength checks as she flailed, trying to dance, and overpowering her. Frain stepped forward, reaching out his hand, and spark of fire in his palm, and cast remove curse on the slippers as Tzaad held her in place.

Lydia suddenly stopped struggling and slumped, knocked out cold. Steph stepped forward and picked up the slippers, examining them and put them into one of the larger 11 pockets in her billowing robes.

Tzaad stood up slowly and hogtied Lydia, taking her cloak, her daggers, thieve’s tools, and 50 gold, giving 10 to each of the others.

“So, should we turn her in to the princess?”, Frain asked the group.

Steph stepped forward, conflicted, “You saw Frendamus, he was terrified of the princess. What do you think would happen to her if we hand her over to the queen?”

Dom shrugged, “She’s probably punished enough from the curse she put on the shoes”.

Tzaad nods, “Yeah, we can leave her”, and began to walk away towards the door. 

After a few steps, he slowed, grumbling to himself and walked back over to her. He pulled out one of the daggers he took and left it lying beside her then turned away. He stopped and turned back again, pulling out some food and leaving that beside her for when she woke up and turned away, walking away.

The others followed behind, touched by his display of compassion for the thief. When they got to the door of the warehouse, they found it was stuck shut. Tzaad hold out his hands for everyone to step back, and he reared up, rolling a 22-strength check and ramming the door right off it’s hinges and running into the opposite wall of a familiar hallways. It was white marble and crystal. They were in the palace!

There were five doorways in this hallway on the way to a bend to the right at the end. The group decided to start checking doors this time. Dom stepped forward and opened the first door to his left, throwing it open and being met with infinity. Creation itself in that of the stars of the universe and a larger than life moon, so close he could touch it. Dom, looking dazed began to step forward and reach out, mouth hanging open, a ringing in his ears blocking out all noise.

Tzaad ran forward quickly, pulling Dom back and slamming the door shut, shaking him. Dom shook his head and snapped out of it, but felt an intense fear of the moon, shivering to himself.

“I’m fine,”, he said, turning away.

Steph inspected the rest of the doors, noticing a small chip on one of them. She stepped forward and opened that one cautiously. She was flung backwards, and a mess of tentacles flailed outwards, reaching for everyone, and grabbing onto Tzaad nearby. Steph yelled and ran forward, pushing on the door trying to close it.

Tzaad pulled out his sword, chopping off tentacles, as Steph inched the door closer to closing until it finally slammed shut. Panting they stood there for a moment, then laughed. Tzaad bent down and scooped up a few pounds of writhing tentacles and put it away for a meal later.

Tzaad started opening the rest of the doors. In the first he saw a fire in the back under a boiling cauldron. In front of it was a hulking true ogre with a belt of bones who looked back suddenly as Tzaad slammed the door shut. The next had walls, floor, and ceiling made of a red squishy padding, and a teardrop looking shaped at the back of it leading to a pitch-black cavern. 

They finally headed down the hallway and came to an ornate crystal door around the bend that looked familiar. Opening it they found themselves back in the throne room, with Princess Dandelion looking bored on the throne. Her eyes lit up as they walked in and she sat up straight.

Steph stepped forward, reaching into the folds of her cloak and pulling out the slippers, holding them out, “Here, we went and picked them up from Frendamus, no issues!”

Steph smiled nervously, holding them out as the princess looked at her. After a few moments, the princess clapped and ran down the step, taking the slippers.

“Delightful!”, the princess cried, and looks at them, sniffing them, “A little ripe, odd, but beautiful!”.

The princess went back to her throne and waved her hand, the slippers disappearing.

“Great, I have them for later. Now on to the next quest!” the princess said, clapping.

“I need you to catch me a suckling warthog for the feast! A fully cooked warthog that still lives out in the wild, running around! It will die once skewered! The quickest way to get it would be to join the Wild Hunt and convince them to track it with you!” Dandelion explained.

“Sagh!”, The princess called out, as Sagh was already entering the throne room. “Oh! Perfect. Please show them out!”, the princess continued, sitting back and looking away.

Sagh shook her head and beckoned to the group, walking down the corridors to another doorway.

“I know why you came to this area by the way. I got some information on it. That organization”, Sagh began pointing at their tattoos, “The winter court is working some intelligence on them I am pretty sure. They’ve been on it for a while and I think they might be able to help you. You’re wasting your time here as it is, but it shouldn’t be much longer.”, Sagh explained.

“Wait, what do you mean, what are you saying?”, Steph asked.

“I’m sorry, that’s all I can say right now, just… endure a little more for now and you’ll get some answers, I promise”, Sagh replied, opening the door.


The group stepped out and looked around, seeing a large clearing not far to the left on a ley line of the hedge grove. Walking over they saw a group of figured in the distance, standing around feeding what looked like horses. 

As they got closer, they noticed all the figures wearing blood-soaked chainmail and animal masks of various forms. They ask the nearest about joining the wild hunt who looks at them silently through the mask. From behind him another figure moved, wearing a warthog mask and stepped forward, pulling it off. Under the mask was a beautiful elven face, with long forest green hair billowing behind him.

“Why, may I ask, do you want to join?”, the true elf asked.

“We need to find a suckling warthog for the feast”, Dom replied impatiently.

The elf looked him up and down and said, “Alright then. I am the Erlking, and these are my entourage. Welcome to the wild hunt. This being your hunt, lead the way!”

The Erlking put his mask back on and stepped back to his horse, hopping on. The other masked figure pointed silently towards four horses and hopped on his own. As the group approached them, they noticed the horses had weird, shriveled bodies with the faces of elves and gnomes. 

Steph grabbed the mask on the side of her horse, a bird mask. Tzaad picked up a white wolf mask, looking suspiciously like Waffle. Frain had a beaver mask, and Dom grabbed a sheep mask.

Dom spun and flipped onto his horse gracefully, Steph gliding up onto hers, Tzaad flopping onto his sideways on his stomach and then scrambling up the rest of the way. Frain took a running start at his and face planted into the side of his horse, back hitting the floor hard. He got up, embarrassed, patted himself off, and scrambled on slowly. 

The group reared their horses back and freeze framed, with a comic book style filter over their personas and a comic header stating, “Our adventurers are off on the wild hunt!”

“I’m game!”, Dom cried out in a comic book bubble.

“No horsin’ around”, Steph’s bubble said.
