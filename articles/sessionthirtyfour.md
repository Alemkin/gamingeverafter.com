Dom saw nothing but red as he continued kicking and kicking.

Frain tapped on his shoulder lightly and jumped back as Dom whirled around and lashed out. “Whoa, hey bud, it is dead. The battle is over…”

Dom looked around, breathing hard, the rest of the shimmering illusion coming back into focus, the bodies of their enemies, dead on the field. Taking a shaky breath, Dom closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them, nodding silently.

Frain shrugged and turned towards the other, “Should we head through that door?” Frain asked, pointing at the door set into the forest wall across the small river.

“Oh! I got this!” Tzaad squealed, hurrying over to the door. He peered closely, inspecting the wood and knob for traps.

“I’ll help you out”, Steph called out, heading over to Tzaad.

Satisfied there we no traps, Frain stepped forward and opened the door.

Through the door was a wide hallway, about 60 ft long, with multi-colored motes of light floating around in the air, illuminating the area. The sweet, elven music was much louder now, drifting through the 15-foot tall set of double doors at the end of the hallway. Approaching it, they saw it was jacketed with a bunch of bronze engravings of an elf playing various instruments. Under the scenes of music, there was the engraving of several robed figures lying curled on the ground, with their eyes closed.

“Hey, maybe that’s that one elf from the sleepy room…” Milo said, pointing at the scenes of the elf plying instruments.

“Yes, that’s possible, what do you think Tzaad?” Steph asked.

“I ‘unno”, Tzaad replied, with a huge shrug of his shoulders, mouth slightly agape.

Steph rolled her eyes and stepped up to the door, pushing on it until it creaked open.

The group was met by the sound of another elven lullaby, sounding as if it was coming from in the room. Looking beyond the door there was a large chamber, 60 by 80 feet, with a barrel-vaulted ceiling covered in faded frescoes. The floors were a mosaic of black and red tile forming patterns of interlocking circles. Beneath the lullaby there was the sound of rhythmic breathing, as if it were snoring, and the scurrying of rats just out of the corner of their eyes. The air smelled of rot, dust, and incense.

“I don’t like the feeling of this place…” Tzaad whispered to the others.

Dom cast detect magic and looked around, spotting a few specks of eternal flame on the chandeliers hooked into the ceiling, one bright spot on a small altar in the corner of the room, and ahead in front of a large stone door set in the southern wall, was the form of Yalunue the elf, paying a bandore lit up like the sun with magic, swaying back and forth facing the stone door. The door itself had a point of magic near the keyhole.

“Hey, there is some magic I that pile of trash over there and that elf from that small room is over there” Dom whispered.

“I got this…” Tzaad said, sneaking over to the pile of detritus before pulling out a large coin and brought it back to the others.

Tzaad held it up to the others, and Steph grabbed it, holding it to her ear and then peering down at it before whispering close to the coin. “Hello?”

“From time immemorial, I came to conquer…” an ethereal voice emanated from the coin.

“Well you don’t see that every day…” Milo commented.

“That must be a soul coin…” Manu said, making everyone jump.

“You have got to stop doing that!” Tzaad hissed between his teeth. “We have to put a bell on you, I swear to Her…”

Manu shook his head, deflating sadly.

“Okay, well, you can hold onto this, Frain” Steph said, handing it over to Frain before turning to everyone else. “Alright, so we should talk to her, I guess… You seem to know her so I think you should talk, Tzaad.”

“Hey, good idea!” Tzaad said, nodding in agreement.

“I’ll cloak myself and sneak behind her in case we need to restrain her.” Mylo explained matter of factly, before vanishing from view and moving into position.

“Alright, I’ve got this thing called banishment in case things go sideways,” Frain said, holding up her hand.

“I’ve got this thing called God…” Dom added, holding his finger to his temple mysteriously.

Tzaad took a deep breath before walking forward, approaching Yalunue. When he was a few dozen feet away, Yalunue stopped playing suddenly and whirled around to face Tzaad. Her eyes narrowed and Tzaad spoke up quickly. “Hey, whoa, it’s me. Remember? You were the bard for the Filthy Five? I was still green, but we spoke a few times!”

Yalunue pointed at Tzaad and began yelling in elvish, gesturing wildly and pulling at her hair.

Tzaad took a step back and spoke out of the side of his mouth to Steph, “A little help here please…”

“Oh right!” Steph exclaimed. “She is uh, she’s saying bad… Stay away… must protect.” Steph began, squinting, obviously struggling. “Her words are all jumbled up. She probably hasn’t spoken in a while.”

“Okay, tell her we’re good. I’m here to help… Tell her Mal sent us!” Tzaad suggested, hands still up.

Steph relayed this and Yalunue cocked her head, quieting for a moment. She asked what sounded like a question and Tzaad shot Steph a questioning look of his own.

“She’s just reiterating what I said, not enemies, sent by Mal, all that.” Steph explained before replying in elvish.

Tzaad smiled encouragingly at Yalunue who had straightened a bit, looking unsure. Steph rolled a natural 20 in persuasion and Yalunue could not stand up to the sheer persuasiveness of a critical roll.

Yalunue visibly relaxed, still hunching a bit but not looking hostile. She nodded and pulled a comically large key out from under her tunic, attached to a necklace. She turned back towards the door and stuck it into the keyhole, turning it with a loud “clunk”.

At the same time, Mylo popped back into view near the rest of the group, winking at Dom who jumped and probably peed a little.

The stone door swung outwards, towards the group and inside was a lightly illuminated tomb. Rows of square holes lined the three walls of a 50 square foot room. In the middle of the room was a stone coffin with “Horst Atherace” engraved on the side. 

“I recognize that name… He was the head cleric in the company!” Tzaad said, stepping forward. Tzaad grabbed the edge of the lid and heaved it off.

Inside was the sleeping form of Horst, a heavy-set human with a shaved head and goatee, eyes closed, snoring peacefully. Tzaad reached in and shook him on the shoulder. “Wake up!”

Dara walked up and moved Tzaad to the side, rolling her eyes. “He’s obviously under an eternal slumber. I can break it, so just give me some time. I’ll get this guy first, then the rest.” Dara explained, pointing along the walls before holding out her hands and closing her eyes.

Frain looked up and around at the wall, realizing there were people in them. “Whoa…”

After a minute, Horst’s eyes fluttered open and he sat up slowly, wincing and holding his head. He looked around and his eyes fell on Tzaad, and then flicked beyond him to Yalunue.

Horst stood up shakily and began to climb out.

“Oh, let me help you sir!” Tzaad proclaimed, grabbing onto Horst’s arm, and helping him over the lip of the coffin and onto the stone floor.

Horst nodded and spoke in a booming voice, “Yes, Tzaad was it?”

“Yes sir!” Tzaad replied, standing at attention and saluting.

“Yes, yes… I remember you, always so earnest. But you are much older than I remember. It must have been a while since we went down…” Horst continued.

“Yes sir, about 10-15 years, I’m not exactly sure”, Tzaad replied, still at attention.

Horst nodded, “At ease.”

Tzaad sighed and relaxed.

“Now, the rest of the people here. There are 24 clerics and priests, and about 30 or so civilians. If you would not mind helping me to get them up” Horst explained, before turning and heading towards the nearest wall.

Horst and Dara got to work, methodically waking each person up and helping them out of their holes.

Dom watched the process, holding his breath, eyes darting around at the growing throng of people until his eyes fell on a couple that looked familiar. The man with buns of steel, a curled mustachio, sturdy build… The woman with long, wavy, hair and a worried look on her face.

“Mom… Dad…” Dom whispered to himself, before walking slowly towards them. He wiped away the blood of the succubus on his way and sheathed his blade. Suddenly he was standing before them.

Fabio, his father, looked into his eyes as Dom stared back. Fabio opened his mouth and spoke, “Who are…”

Before he could finish, Dom reach forward, placing on hand on Fabio’s shoulder and one of his mother Maya’s, and they both disappeared with a pop.

Dom nodded to himself and turned back to the entrance of the tomb, walking back with a spring in his step.

Mylo, witnessing the whole thing called out to Dom, “What did you just do?”

Dom quirked the corner of his mouth and raised one eyebrow, tapping his chin, but didn’t answer.

Mylo shook her head and chuckled.

“You…” Fabio finished. He blinked, looking around at the rows of pews, stone recesses I the wall, various altars, and finally a sign near the door that read: “Non-Denominational Place of Worship”.

“Where are we?” Maya, proclaimed, before looking down at the altar in front of them, depicting Zeus, and a single piece of folder paper with the words: “Maya and Fabio” written on the front.

Maya picked it up and unfolded it, reading it out loud. “It’s your turn to wait.” She flipped it over. “You’re in Queen Mab’s domain, she’ll take care of you, Love Dom.” Maya finished. “Oh my, our son?” Maya whispered.

Horst finished speaking to everyone that was awakened and walked over to Steph. “So, I presume we’ll need to get out of here, but first everyone here will need some rest. They are exhausted.”

Steph nodded. “I have just the thing!”

Steph flourished her hands, reaching into her cloak of many pockets, pulling out reagents and tossing them into the air, chanting. Suddenly a shimmering portal appeared before her.

“My magnificent mansion! I still have the other one running for Lt. Mal and his squad, so things are slightly different in here…” Steph explained, a bit sheepish.

Horst nodded and corralled everyone through the portal before speaking with the group again. “I thank you for the service you have all rendered in finding and awakening us. I would like you to take this Ion Stone of Leadership as a token of gratitude”.

When you use an action to toss the stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at 1d3 feet and your charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits you head.

Yalunue stepped forward, holding out the bandore she was playing, nodding, and pushing it towards Steph.

“Oh, thank you!” Steph said, taking the instrument and inspecting it, gaining the understanding of it’s attributes: 
An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage. You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC. You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component. All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly, invisibility, levitate, and protection from evil and good. In addition, the Fochlucan bandore can be used to cast entangle, faerie fire, shillelagh, and speak with animals.

Steph put it away and bowed at Yalunue before turning to the other. “Alright let’s head inside and get some rest.”

Everyone headed through the portal. The inside looked like the usual mansion Steph cast, except everything had a… lavender tinge to it. Half of the servants were helping the guests; the other half were wandering around spritzing lavender scented mist into the air. All the cushions and pillows were tinted lavender. The spread on the table was brunch, but lavender inspired dishes. 

Steph strode to the table and began stuffing her face. “Man, I am famished!” Steph exclaimed; voice muffled through mouthfuls of food. Waffle lumbered up beside her and was more selective from the buffet.

Tzaad rubbed his hands together and stepped forward, shoveling waffles into his mouth. “Got to eat as many THAWs as I can!”

“Thaws?” Frain asked.

“Yeah, Thick Ass Waffles!” Tzaad explained, rolling a natural 20 for performance. Suddenly he felt the weight in his stomach lighten and gained the feat “Tzaad’s Magnificent Stomach”. He could now eat as much food in one sitting as he wanted without getting sick, and he couldn’t’ be poisoned by ingestion.

“Whoa, awesome…” Tzaad said, smiling.
