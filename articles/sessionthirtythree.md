Steph held her left hand gingerly as Frain finished applying some bandages after healing the hole were her pinky used to be closed.

“Well, that should do you for now!” Fran exclaimed, before shooting a look over at Dom. “You doing okay bud?”

“Yeah, the break healed but I’ll need to keep it in a splint for a while… Too bad about my toes though…” Dom replied, closing his eyes and sighing.

Frain nodded, putting on his best sympathetic face… He was getting good at this stuff. “I feel you bud, sorry for your loss.”

“Alright, we should rest up before moving on!” Tzaad declared, before plopping down.

After a few moments, a shadow appeared behind Dom, who did not seem to notice. Steph looked over at Dom, her eyes widening. The others soon noticed and stared as well. 

After another moment Dom notice everyone staring at him. “What? Do I have something on my face?”

Dom felt a chill and turned around then.

“Boo!” Milo yelled, raising her hands in an imitation of a ghost, and making a funny face.

Dom yelled and jumped back, hands raised, ready to chop. A second later he realized who it was. “Mylo! How did you find us?”

Mylo stood up straight and grinned, “I was following a bounty hunter on Queen Mab’s orders. After a while I lost him but followed essentially a sea of corpses to you guys. There is a LOT of carnage back that way…”

Tzaad shrugged, “What are you going to do, we kill a lot of people. Am I right guys…? Guys?”

Mylo shrugged, “Well, what are you guys up to? I’ve completely lost that guy’s trail.”

“We’re heading to tomb of the inner sanctum to resurrect the clerics of the Hellriders, and possibly Dom’s parents!” Steph recounted with one finger raised.

“What she said” Tzaad grunted.

“Hey, you think that bounty hunter is after us?” Dom asked.

Mylo shrugged again, “No idea. His name is Spurhund, and he is an orthon, but that is about as much as I know. I was tracking his scent”.

“His… scent?” Dom asked, eyebrows raised.

Mylo nodded and shrugged, her favorite gesture.

The party finished their rest, restoring health and conversing before Steph spoke up again. “Alright, we should continue on.” She pointed down the hallway through the pillars at the door at the end.

Tzaad sprung to his feet. “I’ve got this, do not worry!” He proclaimed, before scrunching down, turning sideways and… crab walking down the corridor.

Dom, Manu, Mylo, Steph, and Frain all looked at each other, thoroughly confused. Steph scrunched down suddenly, and crab walked behind Tzaad, following him to the doorway. Tzaad looked back and smiled.

Once they reached the door, Tzaad stood up straight and pulled out his notebook. He drew a picture of a simple crab with an A+ next to it, nodding to himself. He was sure this is what smart people did now, it was confirmed by Steph doing it herself. 

Tzaad put the notebook away and turned back to the others. “All clear, come on down!”

The rest of the group followed normally and stood outside the door. The sound of elven music seemed particularly strong just beyond the doorway.

“Sounds like, a lullaby… It’s one my mother used to sing me before bed” Steph explained.

Tzaad nodded to himself and pulled out some leather, ripping a few strips off and showing them into his ears. He looked at the others who nodded before he reached down and pulled open the door.

Inside was a small, 10 foot by 15-foot chamber, with a red and black tile infinity symbol on the floor. Small motes of light danced near the ceiling, 8 feet up. On the western wall just across the room was a plain wooden door. The room seemed to be filled with the lullaby. 

Tzaad stepped in gingerly, moving towards the middle. After a few steps, a mote of light floated near him. Tzaad stared, transfixed for several seconds.

Steph stepped in after Tzaad, noticing him spacing out. She tapped him on the shoulder and raised her hands questioningly at him when he looked around at her.

“Oh, hmm, sorry, I must’ve been daydreaming or something… Where was I?” Tzaad blurted out, flustered.

Suddenly, everyone but Tzaad, Steph, and Mylo were overcome with drowsiness. Failing their charisma saving throws, Frain, Dom, and Manu fell asleep. 

Suddenly, an elven figured clad in intricate green leather, and long brown hair burst into the room, a halo of light behind her from the room beyond the door. 

“You, intruders! You must leave here at once!”, the elven woman exclaimed.

Tzaad raised his eyebrows, recognizing her as the company bard for the Filthy Five. He pulled the leather out of his ears and stepped forward. “Yalunue… it’s me, Tzaad. Do you remember?”

After a few moments, Yalunue blinked and said, “It doesn’t matter why you’re here, just go!”

Waffle meanwhile had snooted everyone awake who had fallen asleep. Dom rubbed his face off and looked over at Yalunue. He squinted his eyes and cast detect magic. The entire form of Yalunue lit up.

“Hey guys, I don’t think she is real…” Dom called out as he stood up, brushing himself off.

Tzaad’s eyes glinted before he quickly unsheathed his moon blade and slashed at Yalunue. Yalunue shimmered and disappeared in a poof. The door slammed shut behind her.

Tzaad rushed forward and opened the door back up. He shielded his eyes, blinded by sunlight streaming through from the room beyond. “What the heck…”

The room was 100 feet across, and 90 feet wide. Above there was a bright blue sky with Her illuminating from above, shining bright. The room seemed to be a small forest meadow, with a babbling brook running down the middle. On the other side was a door set into the wall.

Tzaad walked in, followed by the others.

“Wow, this is crazy…” Manu said in awe.

Dom looked around, detect magic still active. “It seems this is illusory magic, what we see isn’t real, but at least it’s pleasant”.

As they moved towards the brook, Mylo noticed some movement in the corner of her eye and heard the rustling of some bushed. She narrowed her eyes. A moment later, Mylo threw a knife at a tree to their right, and it thudded into the bark, rigid.

“Whoa, whoa, okay, hold on now!” a voice with a heavy cockney accent sputtered before an orthon appeared out of thin air next to the knife, hands up. 

Mylo smirked, “Looks like I found Spurhund”.

“Yeah, yeah, you found me! But hear me out…” Spurhund began. 

“All right, talk”, Dom replied impatiently.

Spurhund nodded, “Right, well, I’m just here for the girl you see. Maybe we can have a little trade?”

“Girl…?” Steph asked.

“Yeah, the girl, right there” Spurhund pointed at Dara.

Waffle stepped in front of Dara, hiding her from view.

“We have no idea what you’re talking about bud, there is no girl here.” Frain said.

“If you want a girl, we can find you one though, what are you offering?” Tzaad said.

“What… No… I want Dara, the girl with you, not just any girl… You’d trade me a random girl for goods?” Spurhund sputtered.

“Depends on what you’re offering, but there is no Dara here anyways”, Steph replied, shrugging. 
 
“I feel like I’m goin’ crazy, none of you saw that girl there, behind the wolf?” Spurhund asked incredulously, pointing.

Mylo took a step towards Spurhund but noticed a sound behind her. It was too late however, as a crossbow bolt slammed into her back, tossing her forward, and locking the team in combat. 

Spurhund grinned, “Got yah.” He waved his hand and 4 succubi appeared, two near Spurhund, and 2 near the other orthon on the other side of the brook. “Meet my brother, Dorthund.” Spurhund said, chortling.

Manu charged forward, taking a swing at Spurhund, knocking him to the ground. Tzaad followed and stabbed Spurhund a few times. Steph cast a protective spell around Dara and moved into formation with Waffle around her.

The succubus to the left of Spurhund blew a kiss at Tzaad. “Hey big boy, I like em’ tall, dark, and handsome. Why don’t you come over here and play with me for a little bit?” 

Tzaad failed his saving throw and drooled a bit. “I see through your wiles you she-devil… But heck yeah, I’m in!” Tzaad replied enthusiastically.

The succubus to the right called out to Manu, “I don’t want my sister to be the only one having fun tonight, what about you, are you up for some fun?”

Manu rubbed his chin, failing his saving throw. “Yup, yup, absolutely, count me in!”

Tzaad looked over at Manu, “Eiffel tower?”

“I have no idea what that is, but heck yeah, whatever you want buddy!” Manu replied.

Frain tossed guiding bolts at Dorthund, trying to weaken him, and Dom was charmed by the succubus to Dorthund’s left. Dom moved over to her and stared. 

Mylo rushed forward and dealt a devastating blow to the Succubus that had charmed Tzaad.

Tzaad shook his head and looked around. He stalked to the Succubus that charmed Manu and stabbed her through the heart and looked her in the eyes. “Nobody tries to get me to Eiffel tower with Manu…”

“I have no idea what that is…” The succubus whispered through blood-soaked teeth before dying.

Steph dealt a final blow to Spurhund with a missile.

The succubus that had entranced Dom went in for a kiss, with a little tongue. Dom felt the life draining from here but was able to pull away as the succubus was shocked by his lightning skin, half her face melting. Furrowing his brow, Dom reached up and grab the other side of her face, inflicting wounds and rotting that half of her face off. As she dropped to the ground dead, Dom continued kicking her corpse, screaming in fury. 

Everyone stopped for a moment to stare at Dom. Frain looked over at Steph, twirling his finger near his temple. Steph shrugged.

Mylo, who had hidden in the tree above Tzaad and Manu, suddenly felt a presence behind her in the branch. It was the last succubus who had snuck up here.

The succubus leaned forward, whispering seductively in Mylo’s ear, “Why don’t we take each other for a spin after we’re done here?”

Mylo failed her saving throw and nodded, “Yeah, I’d like that.”

Dorthund fired off a thunder arrow at Frain, dealing area damage.

Frain cast Faerie Fire to track his movements while invisible, and Steph was able to pinpoint an attack that took him down.

Mylo tossed a few knives out, hitting Steph who took a good amount of cold and necrotic damage.

“Ow! What the heck! Tzaad, in that tree, quick!” Steph cried out.

Tzaad ran up to the tree and peered up, seeing Mylo and the last succubus up there. “Why you…” he began, before pulling out his arrow and shotting up at the succubus, who fell out. Manu advanced quickly and punched her before pulling her into a devastating headbutt, cracking her skull open and dropped her body to the ground.
