Alex – Dungeon Master – Manu the Monk

Ellen – Moon Elf Wizard – Steph

Anna – Wood Elf Rogue – Milo

Rob – Human Cleric – Dom Strongbottom

After the spectacle had died down a bit, everyone drifted to different parts of this flying contraption, exploring its hidden depths. Frain had set himself up in the command room. Dom claimed a small room in the living quarters below deck after stumbling across another room full of those glass drawers and cubes. In his room he set up a small altar to his lord Zeus, with a little drawing of a Z + D surrounded by a crude drawing of a heart.  

As he gently performed a macarena in reverence to Zeus, Steph was busy setting up her own room. Darting through the corridors and in and out of rooms, she was gathering as many pillows as she could and bringing them back to her quarters, setting up an immense pillow fort, the size of her room. Mostly for Waffle, but also for herself. 

While searching for more pillows, Steph noticed another door at the end of one corridor she hadn’t noticed, perhaps full of unclaimed pillows. Walking up to it, she tried to open it by pushing on it. Pushing a little harder and straining her muscles, she failed again. Kicking the door in frustration, she turned to walk away. At that moment there was a hiss as the door slid open. Surprised and delighted, Steph turned back and looked in.

Inside she noticed a small room, with most of the room taken up by a cell separated by bars from floor to ceiling that spanned the length of the room. Inside the cell was a small sleeping figure that looked to be an elf. Looking back down the corridor she saw Dom’s strong bottom sticking out of the doorway to his room, presumably working on his altar some more.

“Um, Dom? Is that your bottom?” Steph called out.

Popping out of his room and looking down the corridor at Steph he replied, “Yeah? What’s up?”

“I think you should come over here and check this out”, Steph continued.

As Dom made his way down the corridor, the figure stirred and woke up. As the elf came to, she noticed a few things. The metallic taste of blood in her mouth, and the unmistakable feeling of being imprisoned. She would know that feeling anywhere, having woken up her fair share of times in a cell. Trying to move her hands she found them at the end of a chain attached to the wall. She also noticed someone talking behind her. Shaking her head, she sat up slowly and then stood up, positioning her arms behind her back and turning to face her captors.

“She woke up!” Steph called back to Dom.

Dom walked in and took in the sight of the prisoner.

“Who are you?” Dom asked.

“You tell me first and then I’ll tell you.”, the elf demanded.

“We asked first, and you don’t seem to be in a position to negotiate here!” Dom retorted.

Winning an intimidation check against the elf, she replied her name was Milo. As Milo relayed this information, she had a few images going through her mind, broken memories of what happened before she got here. She remembered infiltrating Gold Star University’s campus, headquarters of The Order of the Polyhedron. As she was working her way down a hallway in the dungeons, she had felt a  tingle on the back of her neck, and turned around too late, taking a blow to her temple and being knocked unconscious.

“Alright, my name is Dom Strongbottom”, Dom replied.

“And I’m Steph! Just Steph.” Steph added. “

“We’re thieves, as you can see, we stole this ship, but we don’t mean you harm”, Dom said.

“Yeah, we don’t kill people on purpose unless you are a jerk”, Steph added.

“Well that’s a relief”, Milo added sarcastically.

As they bantered back and forth, Milo used the incredible finesse of her trade to undo her shackles behind her back stealthily, keeping the shackles in place for now. Dom steps forward, seeing the pad with 5 indents on the wall next to the cell, and pressing his hand to it. A few beeps, then a red light flashed. Steph stepped forward trying next. After the same result, they put their two brain cells together and though hard. After an intense thinking session and too many hints from the DM, Dom had the bright idea to run back to the top deck and get a hand from the dead Mindflayer.

Dom started backing out and threw some finger guns saying, “We’ll be right back to give you a hand, hey!”.

As he did this, he critically failed a performance check and tripped backwards into the hallway, yelling “Ah, fuck!”.

Waffle stepped out and grabbed him by the scruff of the neck, hauling him to his feet, and he ran off embarrassed. Milo watched his voluptuous ass jiggle on his way down the hallways and thought she could guess where he got his name from. 

Dom made his way up quickly and found the Mindflayer, cutting off it’s sticky, tentacled hand, kicking it’s severed head away first, then heading back down. He stepped forward and used it on the pad. A few beeps and green light later, there was a hiss and the door into the cell slid sideways.

Dom stepped in saying, “Let me help you out of those chains now”.

As he did this, Milo slid past him and out of the cell, letting the chains fall to the ground behind her as she did. 

“WHOA! HOW DID YOU DO THAT!?!” Steph exclaimed, exultant in the face of such acrobatics.

Milo shrugged and looked at them suspiciously. 

“Alright then, welcome to our humbly stolen ship! I’m going to head back to my room, feel free to join us, but no stabbing us in the back, okay?”, Steph said, and headed out of the room towards her own. 

Dom and Milo watched her head to her door, looked both ways, then open it up and dive into it for some reason, with Waffle following. As Steph did this a few pillows and several features came flying out of the room. Steph reached out quickly and pulled the pillows back in before closing the door. Milo took this in without saying anything, then cleared her throat. 

“Alright, what now?” Milo asked Dom.

“Let me show you around!” Dom replied. 

Dom showed Milo above deck and they heard some clanking from the control room. Dom stepped forward and opened the door peeking in, then stepping in, beckoning to Milo to join. As they entered they saw a furiously working Manu as the controls, his tunic rolled down to his waist, his rippling muscles of his considerable 6’ 6” height gleaming with sweat, a polyhedron tattoo on his left shoulder, that same sweat plastering his long curly hair to his head. 

“Oh, hey Dom, you here to help out?” Manu gasped out and he turned cranks, flipped levers, and hit buttons. 

“Uh not really, but I can try!” Dom replied. 

Dom introduced Milo, and as he did Milo narrowed her eyes in suspicion, recollecting something. It came to her after a few moments. Ten years before she had encountered someone who looked just like Manu on a mission, culminating in her slitting his throat and killing him, burying him in the forest outside of the City of Scholars, Haven. 

As she had this revelation, Manu showed Dom how to operate the ship.

“Okay, it goes in cycles of five minutes. You want to press the red button, then flips levers 1, 3, and 5, then turn this crank for a minute. After that flip levers 2 and 4, then turn this other crank here for a minute, and make sure you keep the heading on this dial when turning the crank! After that rest for a minute, then hit the red button and start over!”, Manu explained. 

“Uh…” Dom replied. 

Manu showed him one more time, but Dom was distracted by Milo asked him about trusting Manu. After Manu finished, he sat back on a bench, exhausted, and fell asleep, snoring gently. Dom stared at the controls, flustered, and tentatively pressed a blue button. The boat made a harsh lurch to the left, throwing him on top of Milo. They tumbled to the floor and came face to face. At that moment there was a click, and a puff of colored smoke came out of Dom’s front pocket, blasted them both in the face, and knocked them out immediately.

Steph, having just been meditating in her pile of pillows with Waffle sleeping next to her, felt warm sunlight on her face, the smell of smoke and earth, and the feeling of dirt under her hands. Her eyes flew open and she sat up off her back, looking around alarmed. Surrounding her was a forest, and she was lying on a dirt path. Waffle was standing above his, looking down with concern, and Dom and Milo were nearby shaking their heads and standing up, looking around.

Dom looked back down the path and recognized the dandelion farms he had been to before and then back at the others yelling, “Find the goat! The goat, uh, red, two heads?”

“What are you talking about?” Milo replied, annoyed. 

“I’ve been here before, I think there was a goat… wait.” Dom added, before having a flash through his head causing pain, getting a clear message of “Goodroot”. 

Dom looked up and saw a sign, one arrow pointing to the farm and proclaiming is “Dandelion Farms”, and the other arrow point towards “Goodroot farms”. He relays they should probably head to Goodroot, he has a feeling, and they agree and head down the path, still feeling weird about where they are. 

After a few minutes down the path, Steph gets a natural 20 in perception and noticed some bushed rustling up ahead and 3 figures hiding in the bushes. She points this out.

“Oh no, just run, quick!” Dom says as he turns to head the other direction.

Suddenly the three figures jumped out of the bushes. Dom recognized the Jersey Hill Boys and they moved into formation back to back to back in the road. A very short human woman, chewing on something and staring at her nails, the middle one wearing no shirt flexing his rippling muscles, and the other wearing a white linen tank top, all with very orange tans. 

“Stop right there, we’re the Jersey Hill Boys, Sauly D, Sookie, and Guidolo, and you have to pay the toll if you want to move past!” Sauly D yelled out, putting his hands behind his head and flexing his abs. 

“No way”, Dom said.

“How about we fireball you instead?” Steph added.

Holding up a clenched hand like he was going to summon a fireball, Sauly D replied, “How about we fireball YOU?!?”

As they exchanged these back and forth, Milo snuck behind them and hit a natural 20 stealth, seeming to teleport behind Sauly D, holding a dagger to the small of his back and whispering in his ear, “How about we just kill you?” As she did, she noticed despite how solid Sauly D looked, he felt brittle as a bag of glass orbs under her grip, as if he was just a level one character she could snap like a twig and smiled to herself. 

“Wait, okay, you can pass, I don’t even know how to make a fireball!”, Sauly D cried out.

Guidolo took a step back, alarmed, but Sookie kept staring as her nails, chewing on something nobody could see and ignored them. Dom, Steph and Waffle walk past, and Milo backed up, following behind them and sheathing her dagger. 

As they moved away, Guidolo stepped forward and pulled up his tank, showing off his rippling abs and crying out, “Yeah you better run, and don’t come back!”

The three of them jumped back into the bushes.

After a few more minutes the group came up to a large clearing, pulled of field workers, all non-human, harvesting what looked to be beets, larger than a halfling’s head! A little way back at the farmhouse, they saw a group of human guards clustered around what looked to be a small half elf girl, animatedly talking, looking like she was giving them a piece of her mind. 

As the group approached them, they caught the end of the conversation.

“You’ll have the bets owed by dawn tomorrow, or we’ll be taking this farm!” the lead guard said.

The guard flicked the little girls pointed ear and turned around, sweeping her cloak and heading down the stairs and towards the group. The other guards fell into formation behind her in lock step. Steph gave them a dirty look on their way by. 

They head guard looked over and then away, holding her nose and saying, “The stench of elf is heavy on the air today”.

The following guards laughed out mechanically and continued on past. 

“Oh yeah, I forgot how racist this place was”, Dom commented after they were far enough away.

They walked up the steps of the farmhouse to the little girl.

“What’s going on here?”, Dom asked.

“Wouldn’t you like to know, human!”, the girl replied with hostility.

Milo stepped forward with her hands raised saying, “Hang on we mean you no harm, he’s cool, just tell us what’s wrong”. 

After staring at them for a moment, the girl began to cry. 

“I’m in trouble, real trouble and I don’t know what to do, do you think you can help me?” she asked them.

“I can pay you! My name is Constance by the way”, she continued.
 
The others looked at each other and introduced themselves.

“Of course, we will help. What’s going on?” Steph said. 

Constance beckoned to them, heading into the house and they followed. In the back she opened a down and heading downstairs into the cellar. After going down a short corridor she grabbed a lantern and lit it, opening the door it was next to, and looking back ashamed before heading in.

“I’m sorry about this”, Constance said as they piled in, and she headed over to a barrel in the corner, opening it up and revealing two pale figures inside, looking like they were resting except for the blank staring eyes and purplish bruises and bumps on their faces.

 “I found them like this a few days ago, and I’m not old enough to inherit the farm for a few months! If they find out, they’ll take the farm and I’ll have nowhere to go. And there is one more thing.” Constance explained.

She headed back out into the corridor and into the next room over, shing the light on a small, sick looking drow sitting against the wall, breathing shallowly and unconscious.

Steph stepped forward, examining him. After a few moments she gave him a swift slap to the face, and he woke up startled. After he calmed down, he explained he was a Drow from the Underdark that was doing smuggling work for the Goodroot family, Constance’s parents, as the Lord of Jersey Hill kept all goods from leaving the serfdom, and showed them a contract confirming it. 

Steph inspected him a little further and was able to recognize his affliction as “The rot”, a fungal infection with no cure that took over the body and explained to the others about it. 

As they are talking about this, the cellar door slammed shut suddenly, and they hear a few voices from either side of the door moving closer.

“Wot do we have ‘ere Abel? Cupla’ wankas’ is wot it looks like ta me”, Jim Bulge spoke up in his signature cockney accent.

“Yeh’. A couple of right wankers indeed”, Abel Bulge replied.

“What do you want?” Milo asked them.

“Why, we’re bounty unters’, lookin’ for this little drow ere’, killed his master up north at his mansion and ran off to tha’ underdark, little wanker”, Jim explained.

Dom and Steph looked at each other and shrugged.

“Alright, you can have him”, Dom replied.

Jim, looking suspicious, putting his knife away slowly and moved over to the drow. Milo raised her eyebrows and looked back and forth between Steph and Dom.

“I’ll warm you, he has the rot, super contagious. You might not want to touch him”, Steph called out as Jim leaned in.

Jim looked back at her then back down at the drow with a look of disgust in his face, “There might be something to that, hmm. We can come back when he’s dead, oy’ guess”.

Jim inched back to the front and Abel. “Alright then, well, see yah’”, Jim called out and they headed out, closing the door.

“Wait, could you keep the door open?”, Steph called out.

Jim reached back in and opened the cellar door back up calling out, “See yah later wankas’”.

Constance sniffled again and they talked about her problem with the guards. After some discussion they decided to work until dawn to pick enough beets to get the guards off her back for now. 

There was a cut to a montage of everyone working by the light of torches in a field full of beets. Steph was hauling beets out, handing them to Waffle, and Waffle tossed them back into a few barrels. Dom and Milo worked together in a similar fashion, dirt and beets flying. Constance had her hair up in a ponytail, sleeves rolled up, and lining her own barrel with picked beets. 

They worked until star rise, when She rose over the horizon, and they all collapsed onto the dirt, dirty, sweaty, and exhausted, watching her rise in the sky slowly.

“She must have been watching over me and sent you to help. Praise her! It’s going to be a beautiful morning and great day!”, Constance cried out.

“Can’t Beet that”, Dom said, looking at the rising star, as everyone faded to black unconsciousness once more.
