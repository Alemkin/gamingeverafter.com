Dom and Frain looked at each other, eyebrows raised, and shrugged as they looked back into the darkness of the tunnel ahead.  Dom stepped forward and used his light cantrip on a piece of rubble before tossing it down the tunnel. After some clattering, nothing suspicious jumped out.

“Alright well, let’s get going”, Tzaad said suddenly, in a raised voice to be heard over the howling of the winds, before trotting into the tunnel.

After about fifteen minutes Tzaad led the group out into an open cavern about 50 feet in diameter. Ahead of them were 4 tunnel entrances, each with a different symbol carved above them. From left to right were a Sword, Horns, a Shield, and a Mountain. 

Frain rubbed his chin, peering around at the entrances. “I count four… but it said Filthy Five out front… Tzaad, are you possibly the fifth?”

“I… what?” Tzaad replied, confused. “Wait a second, it’s just the name of the fifth company of Hellriders!”

Frain chuckled and shook his head, “You’re too easy, Tzaad…”

“Hmm, maybe it’s the Horns?”, Dom suggested.

Steph shrugged and replied, “Could be, devils, horns, makes sense”.

After agreeing to head that way they all gathered at the entrance. Dom threw another light rock down the tunnel, which rolled at the feet of a devil that swiveled around and charged them. Without much time to think they were locked in combat.

“Oh crap!” Tzaad yelled before drawing his sword and ducking a blow the lead bone devil threw at him. “Looks like we got three bone devils and three barbed devils!” Tzaad called out, moving into striking distance to set up his next attack.

Frain cast toll the dead, and hallowed ringing filled the devil’s ears. Dom was casting guiding bolts. 

Manu flowed between the devils with grace, whacking and punching enough to down a few.

“Wow, great job!” Steph called out.

Manu looked back at Steph with a grin plastered on his face and threw her a double finger gun, feeling proud of himself. Steph felt a sudden rush of power as she gained advantage from perfectly timed finger guns!

Steph yelled out and cast a spell nobody could quite make out. Suddenly tentacles sprouted from the ground underneath some of the devils and began to thrash around.

“Things are about to get weird…” Frain whispered to himself.

Waffle ran in with a frost breath, finishing most of the last devils. Tzaad stepped forward and in one final sweep of his moon blade, severed the final devil’s head from his body in a spray of blood.

“I rung his bell…” Frain exclaimed.

“Yeah… Wait, I did that!” Tzaad retorted. “Let me, let me. Ahem… He must have showered with… Head and Shoulders.” Tzaad flourished his hands and looked back, with a grin plastered on his face.

Everyone had a blank face on, and the faint sound of hell crickets could be heard in the distance. Tzaad head dropped and his arms fell to his side.

Steph inched around Tzaad and started down the rest of the tunnel. “Might as well see where this leads us”.

After about fifteen minutes of travel, they came to a save in with no apparent way past. Sighing all the way, they backtracked and rethought their position in the next room. After deliberating they decided to head down the path of the Sword.

“Okay, stand back, I got it this time!” Tzaad proclaimed, as he stepped forward towards the tunnel and simply… disappeared from everyone’s sight. He rolled a 30 on a Stealth check with bonuses!

Dom blinked, “What in the world…”

Frain took a few steps forward, “Uh, Tzaad?”

“I’m right here, no worries”, Tzaad said from nowhere in particular.

Frain shuddered, “Alright bud, we’re… we’re gonna head down the tunnel now…”

They followed the tunnel until it came out into another cavern like the last. In this one there were eight tunnel entrances ahead, but the same four symbols above four of them.

Steph reached around in her robe of many pockets and came out with a magnifying glass before walking slowly around the room inspecting the walls. “There’s got to be a clue here somewhere…”

After a few minutes she found a small inscription written in Celestial that Frain read, “Let us smite the fiends.”

“Let’s go check the last cavern!” Dom said excitedly.

Backtracking, they searched the walls in the last cavern as well, and found another message that translated to, “May your sword strike true”.

Things seemed to click into place for our adventurers and they hurried back to the next cavern and decided on the horns route, as in fiends!

Tzaad took lead heading down the tunnel, trying to stealth.

“How you doing in there bud!”, Frain called out.

“Shh!” Tzaad replied.

Suddenly there was the sound of loud buzzing coming from further down the tunnel. Without much time to think Tzaad flattened himself against the side of the tunnel as what seemed to be a gigantic wasp buzzed past towards the others. Steph, thinking quickly, put up a wall of fire in between them and the hell wasp. Unfortunately, it seemed the wasp slipped through without any injury, followed by several more!

Waffle darted in, supporting Steph as they careened towards her and blasted out a frost breath, dealing double damage and annihilating half the wasps in one go! 

“Good girl!”, Steph cried out.

Waffle looked back and lolled her gigantic tongue in satisfaction with the facsimile of a smile.

Manu swept in with his sweeping attacks using Flo, finishing off a few, and Frain taking out the rest soon after.

Breathing hard, Frain smiled suddenly before saying into the silence, “Is this… Raiders of the Wasp Arc!?!?! Eh?”

Everyone groaned.

The group rested for a short while before heading down the tunnel again. At the end they found another cavern, but this time without tunnels, on another doorway with two hand sized holes near the bottom.

Dara stepped forward once again, sticking her hands in without hesitation. After a few moments, there was a rumbling as she stepped back, and the wall slowly opened.
