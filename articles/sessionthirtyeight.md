Frain’s eyes shot open, and he snapped his head left and right, taking in the scene around him quickly. He was lying on a small bed, in a half ring of other beds where his comrades laid, groaning, and stirring. 

Frain sighed and then remembered something, frantically feeling around himself and his pockets for the Illithid heads he had cut off! There, squishing in two of his large, robe pocket, were the head. “Oh, thank Kossuth…”

“What’s that bud?” Dom asked, rolling over and opening his eyes to look at Frain.

“The heads, I got to keep em’!” Frain replied enthusiastically.

They looked around and saw Celestial sleeping on a nearby couch in the corner of the room, nestled in a few blankets, he long, pink tipped dread locks spilling over the back of the couch, a scroll unfurled in her lap.

Everyone else came to after a few moments and looked at each other. Steph hopped off her bed and went over to Celestial, gently shaking her on the shoulder.

Celestial started, “Eh?! Oh, you’re awake!” she exclaimed, her lilting eastern isles accent a bit slurred from drowsiness. She blinked a few times and rubbed her eyes before standing up quickly, dropping the blankets and scroll to the floor.

“How long have we been sleeping?” Tzaad asked through a yawn, sitting up and stretching before hopping off his bed.

“You’ve been asleep for about a day”, Celestial replied. “It seemed to be magical exhaustion, some residual enchantment, like time release side effect… Do you remember anything?” Celestial continued.

Steph nodded and explained, “Yes! We were in Jersey Hill. We have been there a lot in our dreams! We tracked this murderer underground to a ritual and defeated him and a bunch of Illithid! And then, Jim and Abel and a bunch of other people or consciousnesses showed up!” 

“The guards?” Celestial asked.

“Yeah, them.” Frain affirmed.

“They said it was the Astral plane and they were all victims of The Others’ mind control but could exist and be more lucid in the Astral Plane when linked to our own consciousness! They also said they could help in a psychic manner when the time in right.” Steph finished.

“Amazing, truly…” Celestial muttered. “Bartholemew has gone to Haven to convene the Congress of Cats. He’s going to elect emissaries to travel to the far reaches of the land, linked together to relay summons from us to our allies.”

 “Great! I guess we have some time. I suppose I’m a little confused as to how exactly call up help from Jim and the others…” Dom said.

“I actually have an idea on that front!” Tzaad replied excitedly, before hunching over and clenching his fists. He closed his eyes and concentration. “Come to me… Come on… Hnnng…” After a few moments, Tzaad heard a distant voice in his head.

In a familiar cockney accent, he heard Jim comment, “Oy, this is strange. A little slimy in here… Hello!? Hello, anyone home?”

Tzaad let out a whoosh of breath that he was holding, releasing his concentration. Panting he spoke up, “It seems if we think about them, we can summon them, using the power of the mind!”

“Cool! Let me try!” Steph exclaimed, closing her eyes, and focusing. After a few moments, she felt the presence of Jim and Abel.

“Oy, this is better…” Jim said.

“Hey! I was just testing trying to contact you. It worked!” Steph explained.

Abel replied, “That’s great. It seems if you use thought we can be summoned in certain circumstances. Try playing around with it to see what happens. Good job by the way girl.”

Steph internally rolled her eyes and broke her concentration, releasing her hold to Jim and Abel. She opened her eyes and walked over to Tzaad, patting him on the head. “Good job, that was it! I spoke to Jim and Abel!”

“You are very welcome little one.” Tzaad replied, going to pat Steph’s hair back.

Steph tried to dodge but failed her dexterity check, Tzaad’s hand moving around in the air above her head before hitting its mark and rubbing.

Tzaad chuckled, “We should do this more often.”

Frain walked over to a corner of the room and knelt to pray to Kossuth, renewing his inner fire, and pondering the events of the past day. He stood up after a few minutes and turned back to the others who were discussing the intricacies of Furries and their subcultures. He glanced at Celestial who looked immensely confused.

“Uh, guys… What are you talking about?” Frain asked.

Mylo shrugged, “I just have a Furry costume, I’m not one! But that is beside the point. What were you saying Frain?”

Frain’s eye twitched and he replied, “What’s are next steps? We want to learn a little more about this mind connection thing, and I need some stuff…”

Celestial nodded and stepped forward, eager to converse on a subject she had information on. “Yes. Teddy, my brother is awake now, in and out of sleep, but he might be able to answer some questions on the mind control. He was in for so long he might have some residual knowledge.”

“Great, we can do that… Afterward, anywhere to buy some supplies like Frain mentioned?” Dom asked.

“There is actually a Fantasy Costco outlet in the basement! They sublet from Queen Mab and provide much needed comforts to those that live in the castle.” Celestial explained.

“Yes! Fantasy Costco!” Steph exclaimed, and high fived Mylo.

“Right, and, your parents are around here somewhere, Dom. I think Queen Mab assigned them work duty somewhere, but I have not seen them for a while. You’ll have to ask her.” Celestial continued.

Dom nodded once in understanding, “I have a lot to talk about with them…”

“Where is Manu by the way?” Tzaad asked suddenly.

“You remembered me!” Manu’s voice came out higher then usual as he rushed from a chair by the wall over to Tzaad and threw a hug around him. “I missed you too buddy!”

Tzaad stood awkwardly and patted Manu’s hand, “Right, right. I missed you too… Now please get off me.”

“Oh, right!” Manu squeaked, jumping back, and straightening up.

Dom started for the door, “This is great and all, but we should probably get moving. Can you take us to Theodore?” Dom asked, looking back at Celestial.

Celestial nodded and hurried forward, passing Dom, and opening the door of the room they were in, leading them out into the circular hallways of the west residential tower. She led them over a few doors and knocked twice, two sharp raps on the wood.

Michael’s voice called out softly from the room, “Come in…”

Celestial opened the door and stepped into the hospital like room, a bed at the back wall with Theodore in it. His normally lustrous nearly obsidian like skin was flushed, and his rippling muscle was diminished, giving him a more skeletal appearance. Michael sat next to his bed in his wheelchair, and he looked up as they entered.

“Ah, Celestial! Everyone woke up, amazing!” Michael exclaimed.

Steph raised her hand to her mouth, looking at the weakened Theodore, and lowered it again quickly.

Dom flicked his eyes to Steph then back to Theodore. “We uh, were hoping you could help us understand some of the mind control stuff, and how we might connect with some of the consciousnesses stuck in the astral plan that are under the mind control. We met some of them in a dream state.”

Theodore smiled slightly and nodded weakly, “Right to business I see. Good to see you all by the way. I remember our first meeting way back at the academy. I introduced you to Manu… You all seemed to hit it off well. I am sorry we were not more acquainted beyond that. It seems things got a little… hectic.”

“Yeah, you can say that again… One minute we’re following a cat, the next we’re in a spaceship, and then we’re fighting lightning dragons in a sky boat and moving to deal with Fae queens and the balance of life and death in our world in Hell!” Tzaad blurted out in one breath.

Teddy blinked and chuckled a bit, his face contorted back into a bit of pain as he clutched his side. “Oh my, that is… Fascinating. I’d like to hear the full story sometime, I think.”

Frain nodded vigorously. “That would be great, we’d love to tell you!”

“For now, let us talk about the mind control. What I remember is like watching my body from above. I do remember vaguely drifting sometime, in what seems another world. I saw you all occasionally, like you were calling to me. I think if you try thinking on it again and have a specific use case in mind, it might help.” Theodore recounted.

Dom closed his eyes and clenched his fists again, with a look of having bad gas on his face. He thought about being stunned by the Illithid over and over and wanted help. He suddenly felt a holy presence, the sure calm and faith of a paladin. A deep gravelly voice drifted through his psyche, and he felt an extra jolt of power run through him. He felt like he could reroll to save from a stun effect.

“Whoa!” Dom proclaimed, opening his eyes again and looking around. “I felt like I could get some help with stun! I think it works!”

“What about spells? You think we can get specific ones?” Tzaad asked.

Frain shrugged and replied, “Maybe, I can feel some vaguely if I reach out. Maybe Holy Aura?”

Teddy started coughing violently and Michael reach over to him, steadying him and pushing him back down onto his pillow.  “Shh, get some more rest my love…” Michael said softly, bending over in his wheelchair and planting a kiss on Theodore’s forehead, clammy with sweat.

Michael looked at the other, “I think he might need more rest now, he’s not ready for too much excitement yet.”

Dom bowed slightly and nodded, “Right, of course… Thank you for your help. Come on guys.” Dom replied, jerking his head to the door, and walking out, the other following.

Dom turned back to the others suddenly in the hallway, “You know, I just remembered about the librarian. You think we can get some knowledge from him or get his help?”

Celestial shrugged, “I’m not sure, but I do know there is a library in here, we can try there and see if we can find any information.”

Frain nodded, “That sounds like a plan. We should stop by Fantasy Costco first though, so we can replenish our supplies.”

“Of course, this way!” Celestial agreed and walked over towards the glass bridge from the west tower to the main castle and to the freight elevator.

Everyone piled in and Celestial punched the Fantasy Costco button at the bottom.

A grin spread across Tzaad’s face and he reached out for the familiar presence of Hard Pass, his shield, in his mind. After a moment, the smooth jazz always on in the background of his mind began to roll gently through the elevator, and into everyone’s ears. After a few more moments there was a good bit of foot tapping, then swaying, and head bobbing. Then, just as suddenly as it began, it stopped as the elevator came to a stop and opened directly into a Fantasy Costco.

Steph bounded in with Waffle on her heels, giggling as Jingle the Fairy came twirling down from the ceiling, belting out the Fantasy Costco jingle and blowing bubbles.

Steph laughed and jumped up and down singing along, as Waffle hopped around, snapping at the bubbles, and getting awfully close to a nervous looking Jingle the Fairy.

Jingle finished and whooshed away, side-eying Waffle.

Everyone piled in and went their separate ways, down the maze of aisles to find what they were looking for.

Frain wandered over to the jeweler. “Heya… I’m looking for a reliquary, preferably with some ancient artifact in it!”

A balding dwarf with a jeweler’s magnifier in one eye swiveled around and peering at Frain, away from his piled of rubies. “Yes, I think I have just the thing! A small amulet with a piece of the original manuscript for the Book of Her!”

Frain grimaced and nodded, “Fine I’ll take it… And a ruby too!”

Frain felt 2000 gold lighter after that bought and walked back to find the others.

Dom wandered down an armory isle and found a +2 shield for 1000 gold. He looked around and spotted a small machine at the end of the isle and walked over to it. It scanned the shield and allowed him to deposit gold coins in payment right there!

Mylo bought three supreme potions of healing in a similar manner in a different isle.

Tzaad found himself in a weapons isles and picked up a +1 rapier and a vicious longbow.

Steph wandered around, looking for some new clothes and spotted a dwarf woman, with blue highlights in her beard and a brown mohawk. “Whoa, I like the color in your beard!” Steph exclaimed.

“The dwarf turned around and smiled, stoking her beard, “Thanks! How can I help you?”

“I’m looking for some armor and robes. I think I want elven chain armor and something else magical for a robe…” Steph explained.

The dwarf stoked her beard in thought and nodded. “I think I have something you might like… This elven armor is 1000 gold. As for the robes, I have this Robe of Stars… Extremely rare…” 

Steph’s eyes sparkled as she saw it and she smiled, “I think we can make a deal…”

After some haggling and exchanging items, and gathering all the excess gold from her colleagues, she was able to get the Robe of Stars. At a total price tag of 6000 gold. The robe had the following description on its tag:

This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it. Six stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe. While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.

They gathered back near the entrance of the Fantasy Costco. Steph turned out her pockets and everyone else did the same. They put their remaining gold in the middle and looked down at the small pouch of 69 gold.

Tzaad shrugged and said, “All’s well that costs well.”
