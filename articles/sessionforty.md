“And so, you know. That’s why I’ve been thinking a lot about my mortality lately and stuff... I want to survive, but I also want to live, you know?” Tzaad explained, lying on his back on the bed and staring at the strangely smooth, metallic ceiling. 

 

Tzaad felt a tug at the back of his mind and look over at his shield, Hard Pass, who replied, “Mm... Blood.” Tzaad squinted for a moment, seeing the silhouette of a person, but it just turned out to be Hard Pass draped in his clothing. 

 

“I knew you’d understand”, Tzaad said seriously, before twisting around and hopping off the bed, and snatching up his clothes to get dressed. 

 

Steph opened her eyes, realizing she was in her deepest throes of meditation, and blinked, finding herself nearly nose to nose with another face. 

 

Steph yelled and fell back, scrambling back. “Personal space dude! What’s your issue?” 

 

“My issue!? You came here to ME!” Jim replied in an incredulous tone, drawling with his usual cockney accent.  

 

Steph looked around, noticing the pitch-dark abyss she seemed to be floating in. “Oh, this is the Astral Plane, isn’t it? Right, in that case, I was hoping to ask you what you knew about the Illithid. As in those that control your mind presently!” 

 

Jim scratched his chin and paced around, “What you want ta’ know?” 

 

“Well,” Steph began, “We found out a book about them was missing from the library, A Brief History of Tentacle-ly Kind, by Durple Moistface!” 

 

Jim raised his eyebrows before he spoke, “It rings a bell... I believe Durple is some kind of priest or progenitor maybe. They speak of them reverently. And that book is kind of like a holy text for them, they’re always carrying them around... That’s all I really know” 

 

Steph’s eyes widened, “That’s more than enough, thank you!” Steph opened her eyes once more, this time to her real body, sitting on a mound of pillow with Waffle circled around her, fast asleep. 

 

Frain got up extra early, as far as he could tell in this ever twilight realm of Faerie, and spent a few hours meditating and praying to Kossuth. He felt as though he had fallen behind in recent weeks, and needed to repent. 

 

Dom lay on his bed with his hands behind his head, and thought about last night with his mother. He smiled to himself and swung out of bed, grabbing his favorite polishing cloth from the night stand, and moved to the mirror for the daily polish of his strong bottom. 

 

Everyone met out in the corridor, and Tzaad ambled out of his room last, patting his stomach, bursting a bit at the seams. He burped and said, “Whoa, excuse me. Can’t get enough of those thaws, you know what I mean? Ahem, anyways, what’s on the docket for today?” 

 

Frain spoke up, “Well, I was thinking about asking Kossuth for advice. I wanted to use that spell I used in the Spire to ask about the Illithid.” 

 

“What are you hoping to learn?” Tzaad asked. 

 

“Something like what is the best way for us to sneak into the fort, undetected by the Illithid, and destroy the crystals. Or maybe, what the best way to destroy the Illithid with minimal fighting and casualties is.” Frain explained.  

 

“What about asking if there even is a secret entrance?” Tzaad posed. 

 

“No, this is divination. I can get a good answer, we just need to ask the right question.” Frain explained.  

 

Steph cut in, “Maybe the best way to destroy the Illithid!” 

 

“Ah, Steph!” Tzaad exclaimed. “Have you heard anything about the book yet?” 

 

“As a matter of fact, I have!” Steph replied excitedly. “I went to the Astral Plane last night and spoke with Jim. He explained Durple is like a priest or holy figure, and the book is like their holy text!” 

 

“That’s great!” Dom said. “Not much we can do with that now, so I think we should focus on our game plan. Tzaad, where is Mal? Can we get him all set up with the Hellriders?” 

 

Just then, someone came thumping down the central spiral staircase. “I believe I heard my name?” Lt. Mal asked, in his drawling southern continents accent. 

 

Tzaad snapped to attention and saluted. “Lt. Mal, sir!” 

 

Mal chuckled and held up his hands, “At ease soldier. Now, we talkin’ strategy?” 

 

Dom nodded and explained, “We’re trying to figure out a way into the Illithid stronghold. We want to get in with minimum casualties, and destroy the crystal that powers the mind control devices.” 

 

“What if we had a strike force and a distraction. Obviously ya’ll as an elite strike team that infiltrates in the confusion caused by a large-scale assault of sorts on the stronghold...” Lt. Mal explained. 

 

“So, like, we sneak in after you attack?” Tzaad asked. 

 

Frain nodded excitedly, “We have a lot of forces! We could maybe have all the cleric in the Hellriders cast that spell I used in hell to box them in! Forbiddance!” 

 

Lt. Mal smiled, “You’re thinking like a general, yeah. 25 clerics at 25 points around the stronghold, with envoys for protection.” 

 

Steph held up her finger, “Don’t you need expensive stuff for that?” 

 

Frain’s face fell a bit and he replied, “Oh yeah, 1 powdered ruby per cleric would need... I don't know where we would get that kind of moolah. Maybe the Church of Kossuth can help!” 

 

Dom nodded and spoke, “Okay to recap, 1 ruby per cleric, 25 points 1 mile out from the stronghold at equidistant intervals between each cleric. Each cleric should have an envoy consisting of warriors from the Hellriders, the Hunt and the Church of Kossuth?” 

 

Lt. Mal replied, “Now that sounds like a plan!” 

 

“We can use the airship to drop us in once all the Illithid are pushed out! And we can have Tesseract the dragon carry two of the clerics to create a large area over the stronghold itself, getting them in close!” Steph explained. “We’ll want to hit them in the middle of the night though, so we aren’t spotted.” 

 

“I don’t see too well at night...” Tzaad lamented out loud. 

 

Frain sniggered and muttered under his breath, “Humans...” 

 

“I think we got a good plan of action.” Lt. Mal agreed. “Now, how do we call this dragon of yours?” 

 

Everyone looked at Steph, who had a blank look on her face for a moment before her eyes widened. “Oh, right!” Steph exclaimed, before frantically searching her robe of many pockets. She searched faster and more frantically my the second for a minute before she stopped suddenly, hand burrowed to the elbow in a pocket directly at the small of her back, and sighed in relief. She pulled out a sparking sapphire the size of her fist and held it up to Lt. Mal. 

 

“Uh... Thanks...” Lt. Mal said, taking the Sapphire of Tesseract from her. 

 

Frain lumbered up to Mal and tapped the crystal, initiating the call. 

 

A rumbling voice emanated from the precious gem. “Hello Frain, I suppose it is time?” 

 

“That’s right!” Frain replied cheerily. “We need you help storming the Illithid stronghold. Oh, before I forgot, do you have a bunch of rubies, in a cave or something somewhere? We could use them for the mission.” 

 

“Mm, I have a lake, and a bunch of pearls. But all the pearls are mine!” Tesseract thundered. “The last time someone came sniffing around my lake, they took my favorite sword, and used it to crown a king! Never again!” 

 

Frain raised his eyebrows and looked around at the others then back at the sapphire. “Anyways... You’re talking to Lt. Mal Rey now, he’s going to go over the plan with you, okay?” 

 

“Understood...” Tesseract rumbled, and Lt. Mal walked back up the stairs, talking Tesseract through the details. 

 

Mylo spoke up for the first time after observing. “Should we speak to my Queen now? We will need to relay this and begin our journey. 

 

Everyone nodded in agreement and they started to the elevator together, and took it to the main office floor. The doors opened to the normal bustle of the office floor; desks filled with the Fae folk in business attire, clicking away at keyboards and walking around with files. 

 

Dom looked around, using his perception to try and spot Karen, the floor manager. “All clear I think, let’s go!” 

 

The group moved together, weaving through the crowded office the best they could, using their athletics and agility. Steph quickly fell back and got flustered, trying to force her way through. 

 

Suddenly, Steph felt a soft crunch in collision with her leg, and looked down to see a gnome lying on her back, a stack of papers having gone everywhere around her. She was unconscious. 

 

“Oh, my, goodness... I am so sorry!” Steph cried, looking around frantically. 

 

A true elf with a name tag reading “Jeff” rushed over and knelt beside the true gnome. “Jennifer! What happened to Jennifer?!” Jeff looked up at Steph. “Did you do this?” 

 

“Please, it was an accident, I...” Steph tried to explain. 

 

“I can’t believe this; I’m going to have to call HR.” Jeff said. 

 

“What’s HR?!?” Steph asked, close to hysteria. 

 

“Human resources!” Jeff shouted, incredulous. 

 

“I’m not human, so it’s no problem!” Steph replied desperately.  

 

“The human part is because it’s made up of all humans!” Jeff said annoyed. 

 

“But, that’s racist...” Steph replied. 

 

“No, no, no. HR will decide if it’s racist or not.” Jeff explained, as if to a simpleton. 

 

Frain noticed the commotion and turned back, slyly using a healing spell to bring Jennifer back to consciousness. 

 

Jeff looked down when Jennifer stirred. “Jennifer, are you okay?” 

 

Frain grabbed Steph by the arm and lead her away into the crowd. They made it back to he others and quickly shuffled into the small elevator that took them one floor up to the glass office overlooking the main floor. 

 

Queen Mab raised her frosty eyebrows as they entered the war room. “Quite the commotion you caused out there.” 

 

Steph chuckled nervously, “Commotion? Hah, hardly, we’re all good here!” 

 

“No matter. I assume you are here because you are ready to execute on your plan and storm the stronghold. Speak to me.” Queen Mab said dryly. 

 

Mylo stepped forward and stood at attention, relaying all of their conversations and plans. Queen Mab nodded and turned to the table. “I think the timing of this would depend on how fast the Church of Kossuth could get here... Perhaps 3 days hence?” 

 

Dom replied, “Yes, that will probably work. We have some questions about executing our plan with the clerics, what do you think?” 

 

Mab thought for a moment and turned to the war table, moving her hands in unfamiliar gestures, bringing different holographic projections into view and creating an approximation of the battlefield surrounding the stronghold.  

 

“Here is the stronghold, it would be about the size of a football field” Mab explained. 

 

“What is football?” Tzaad asked. 

 

“Oh, I’m surprised you have not heard of it. Everyone has a foot, and they crush them into a large ball and try to get it into each other’s goals.” Queen Mab explained. 

 

Tzaad took a step back, “Who... Who’s feet?” 

 

“Oh, all sorts of feet.” Mab replied succinctly. 

 

“I’m sorry I asked...” Tzaad replied, feeling sick to his stomach. 

 

“Oh, we also need 25 rubies!” Frain interjected. “For the spells...” 

 

Queen Mab smiled, “I think I can arrange something with the Fantasy Costco, they owe me a favor.” She turned back to the war table. “Now, I’m thinking at 1 mile away in equal intervals around the stronghold, you would have 23, 7-foot-tall walls of Forbiddance. Along with the two clerics atop Tesseract creating two large boxes encompassing the entire stronghold, it should create and hell of a hard time for our Illithid friends...” Mab explained, eyes sparkling.  

 

“I... uh... does not compute...” Tzaad sputtered, left eye twitching. 

 

Steph rolled her eyes, “Ignore him. We should airdrop the clerics into position, and be ready to drop in ourselves once the Illithid are preoccupied. One last thing. How do we destroy the crystal?” 

 

Queen Mab pulled out a small, circular metal device and held it out. “This is a subsonic amplifier. It will interact with the frequency of the crystal and shatter it. Use it only on what you want to destroy, it has one use!” 

 

Dom stepped forward and took it, turning it over to examine it. “Awesome, thanks!” 

 

“We need to contact the Church of Kossuth.” Frain said. 

 

Queen Mab nodded and pointed at the corner of the room, where a large white book lay on a small desk. “That is the Watch Book. You can use that to look up numbers to call on your watch. They’ve really taken off at Fantasy Costco, and everyone has one now.” 

 

“Sweet!” Frain said and walked over to the book, and for Head Priestess Bylia’s number and called on his watch. 

 

A grizzled looking, ashen haired dwarven woman answered, wearing long billowing red and white robes, and missing her two front teeth. “Hello? Hello is this on?” 

 

“It’s me! Hello!” Frain replied. 

 

“Oh, how do you fair ashen one?” Bylia answered. 

 

“Great, listen, we need your help defeating the Illithid. For fire and glory!” Frain explained, and added in the circumstances and their position. 

 

Bylia listened intently and nodded. “And what do we get in return?” 

 

“Uh...” Frain sputtered and looked around at everyone. Tzaad shrugged at him. “You can have the... Castle.” 

 

“The castle?” Bylia asked. 

 

“That’s right, the entire castle, and all the furniture in it! Once we take it, it’s yours. A new base of operations, and riches untold!” Frain explained excitedly. 

 

Bylia nodded, “For such a price, we can send two crusade war bands, 15 warriors each.” 

 

Mab walked open and touched the watch, transmitting the coordinates of the stronghold to Bylia. 

 

“Great, we will see you in 3 days!” Frain said. 

 

“Indeed” Bylia replied, and hung up. 

 

Queen Mab walked back to the table and turned her back on the other. “Do you require anything else? If not, make your preparations and report to the airship. You will leave for the stronghold in 1 day to stay on schedule.” 

 

The group agreed and headed out, towards the non-denominational church. They entered and Frain set up a quick altar that he placed one of his severed Illithid heads upon, and cast Divination, asking: “What is the best way to destroy or remove all the Illithid from the plane, without casualties to ourselves or allies?” 

 

There was a flash of fire and light and Frain felt an immense presence in his mind, and he felt it relay information in not quite words... “Be prepared for each and every battle, for you will have to kill them one by one.” 

 

Frain shook his head and stood up, “Well that was a waste. We gotta kill them all normally!” Frain explained to the others. 

 

“All right, welp I’m gonna head to the ship to prep it for flight and clean it up.” Tzaad said, and turned to go. 

 

Frain headed to his quarters to get some rest. Dom lingered in the church to convene with Zues, performing his signature macarena. Steph followed Tzaad to help with the ship, and brushed Waffle out to prepare her coat for battle.
