While our adventurers were recuperating in the main medical room, feeling worse for ware after their recent encounters, Steph decided to make the best of being invisible and scout ahead past the hallway. Steph crept down the corridor as stealthily as she could, using her sneakers, and approached the door at the end of the hall. Upon approach, it gave a hiss and slid to the side. Along the back wall of the room beyond, a simple rectangular room like the rest, was a row of six of the automatons they had already encountered. As the door opened, they swiveled towards her, scanning for the source.  Even with advantage and fantastic rolls, one of the bots caught just the barest reading of life and took a shot at the hallway.

Steph yelled out and ducked down, the shot missing her by inches and making it into the other room with everyone else, startling them out of their thoughts. Tzaad spared no time unsheathing his moon blade and pulling out Hard Pass, charged down the hallway, and stopped just behind where Steph would be. 

“What’s going on!?”, Tzaad cried out.

“Looks like we got some trouble in the form of even more of those damn robots”, Steph replied. 

Entering combat, the guard bots took turns lining up to take shots at Tzaad, whom they could see down the narrow hallway. After successfully dodging their lasers, Tzaad and Steph made a hasty retreat through the other doorway, hoping to bottleneck the robots at the other end.

Dom, resident strong bottom of the group, was having absolutely no more nonsense from these robots, and prepared a Shatter spell beefed up with Channel Divinity. With a perfectly lined up shot and the robots clustered together after their attacks on his allies, Every. Single. Robot. Was destroyed from the magnificence of the spell. 

Thinking the danger had passed, our heroes relaxed for a moment, only to be surprised by another alert and four more of the guard bots streaming out of the doorway to the left in the room the other bots were just destroyed.

Back in action, Steph tossed a fireball down among them, finding it less effective. Celestial pulled out a new trick with her Merv’s Mini Meteors circling about her head and striking in twos. After a minute of intense battle, they take these bots down just as well. 

Creeping into the room, prepared for more robots to show up, they check inside the room the other robots came out of. Inside was a large set of robot arms that looked like it was used for repairs hanging from the ceiling, and thousands of glass drawers containing small parts, gems, and metals. Steph backs out slowly, wary of messing with any more drawers and everyone decides to move through the door to the right of the room. 

Steph crept down this hallway to another door at the end, scoping it out once again for everyone else. Another hiss and slide later, she peered into a room smaller than the rest, square in shape, with computer screens lining the walls and a large monolith rectangle in the back of the room, with a tube of liquid with a form in it next to the monolith. On the screens were video feeds of the various areas they had been, and blueprints of the ship and other creatures, cycling through as a quick pace. The monolith at the back whirred and a set of flashing lights scrolled up and down the front.

Steph stepped forward to get a better look at the large cylinder of liquid, but as she stepped over the threshold, the lights in the room came on and a curtain was dropped in front of the cylinder. Just then a voice coming from the monolith spoke up.

“Welcome, I’ve been expecting you. Please come in and have a seat”, the voice said. 

Gasping, Steph stumbled back and ran back to the others.

“There is someone in that room, speaking to me!”, Steph cried out.

Tzaad pulled up Hard Pass and charged through into the room. Looking around he did not see anyone, but the voice spoke again.

“Please, there is no need for that, have a seat and indulge me for a moment”.

A set of chairs emerged from the ground under Tzaad and Frain who had run in together, and swept them off their feet, scooting them forward toward the monolith. Tzaad stood up quickly again and called to the others. Everyone came in quickly to see what the commotion was about. 

“Forgive me for the theatrics, you are probably wondering who I am”, the voice began. “I am a sort of animated golem that serves the masters of this ship”, it continued. 

Tzaad, having none of this and noticed the curtain, went to unveil what was behind it. 

“Wait just a moment please, before you do that!”, Golem cried out as Tzaad went for the curtain. “You won’t understand!” it continued.

Tzaad threw back the curtains, and what they were confronted with was hard to comprehend. Behind the curtain, floating inside the tube of liquid, was Manu the Monk, rotating gently, buck naked. 

Crying out, Tzaad reared back and took a swing with all his might at the glass, not thinking to hard about it. With a might thud his sword struck the glass with all the power of his impressive strength. After a moment, a small crack appeared and grew larger. After a few more moments it grew larger and larger, spiderwebbing the glass before it shattered, sending the liquid spilling onto the glad. Tzaad reached out and caught Manu as he came tumbling out. Trembling in his arms for a moment, Manu began to hack up the fluid in his lungs. After 30 seconds or so he looked around wildly. 

“Manu, it’s me, Tzaad!”, Tzaad proclaimed happily at Manu.

Looking at him for a moment, Manu replied, “Wait, who are you and where am I?”

“Just a moment please”, Golem spoke up.

A second later, a large metal arm began extending form the monolith and quickly hooked into the back of Manu’s neck. Manu jolted in Tzaad’s arms and began to jerk around wildly.

“What are you doing to him you bastard”, Tzaad cried out as he swung at the metal arm with his sword. 

He was not able to do much damage and a moment later, the arm retracted, and Manu was left panting. 

Looking around again Manu spoke up once more, “Tzaad? Celestial? Dom? Frain? Steph? What’s going on, and how did I get here? We were just...” Manu trailed off a bit confused. 

After confronting Golem again, he began to explain the circumstances.

“To begin, I would like you to meet Manu 746. The original Manu appeared here nearly 400 years ago after our crash landing and caused quite a bit of damage to our ship and some of the masters. Due to his expertise we decided to continue employing his services indefinitely”, Golem explained.

Steph stepped forward asked, “Who are these masters you keep talking about?”

On the screens around them appeared the images of Illithid, a creature known as Mind Flayers in this Realm. Gasping out loud having heard rumors of these monstrosities, everyone took a step back. 

“Where are they now?”, Dom asked. 

Golem’s flashing lights turned red. As the adventurers asked again, the red lights flashed and what looked like a timer appeared across the lights in the alien script. 

“Self-destruct sequence initiated.”, Golem chimed out and began counting down.

Freaking out and discussing after a moment, they decided their best course of action was to finish going up and get to the floating ship. Frain grabbed Manu to go back and get his stuff. Along the way Frain decided to use a puff of the magical gas of Manu, but it seems to have no effect. Manu grabbed Flo and his clothing from the dissection room, trying to ignore his own head in one of the jars, and tossed it all on, finally exiting his naked status. 

Dom stepped behind the monolith and found another doorway. Inside was a staircase leading up and they all ascended to a small cylindrical room, seeming to be the nose of the ship, with a small doorway straight ahead. Manu and Frain having caught up, they open the door and found a narrow rope bridge connecting the floating ship to this metal one. They quickly cross the bridge single file, and everyone made it onto the ship. On the top deck, Tzaad, Celestial, Manu, and Waffle head down the stairs to the main deck to the front where the captain’s quarters looked like they would be. 

Suddenly, everyone’s polyhedron tattoos began to burn intensely. Most of them were incapacitated immediately, but Tzaad and Steph were able to barely hold on.

Out of the captain’s quarters straight ahead, out of either doorway levitated two Mind Flayers. Tentacles wiggling menacingly, they all felt the exertion of their will on their minds. Struggling to fight it, Tzaad cried out, swinging his sword wildly, managing to take a few tentacles off the one out of the right doorway. Manu was able to whack one, and Celestial got in a biting word.

Angered, it stepped forward and emanated a mind blast that incapacitated everyone else. Struggling as they approached for the kill, the situation was looking extremely dire. The Mind flayer on the left grabbed Celestial who was closest, and the right grabbed Tzaad. Waffle was able to break free and used a frost breath on the one grappling Celestial, freeing her. Steph was able to break free of their control next and used a thunder wave, avoid her teammates and knocking the one on the left off the ship. It barely missed grabbing the side of the ship and began floating down to the ground 150 feet below the ship.

Manu broke free himself as the other Mind flayer when in for a killing blow with a Brain Extraction of Tzaad, and used a flurry of blows, managing to free Tzaad and knocking the Mind Flayer prone in the process. Tzaad screamed out, free and used all his might, bringing his sword down on the mind flayer’s neck and severing it from his body. 

Using action surge he moved to the other side of the ship, pulled out the anti-matter rifle he had found earlier and aimed at the other one floating down, and with 2 well placed shots, got it straight through the heart and head, ending its life and it fell full speed the rest of the way down to the ground. Breathing heavily, everyone regained their composure and looked down at the splattered body of the mind flayer and saw Princess Featherwind bending over its body, squawking. 

“Oh crap, can we down there?” Steph asked. 

“Wait a minute, I think I can fly this ship”, Manu chimed in, and ran into the captain’s quarters. 

As Manu was clanking and clacking in that room, Tzaad bent down to check the mind flayer on the ship. In the folds of it’s robes he found a chain around its neck with a polyhedron on the end of it, like a pendant. And in one pocket a small rectangular remote with four buttons on it and a few slits that looked like a speaker on the bottom. Tzaad handed the device to Steph, hoping she could figure out what it was.

Steph concentrated and performed her ritual of comprehend languages. After a few minutes she was able to make out the lettering under each button. They read: Command, Cripple, Kill, and Release. Steph pressed the Command button and spoke “sit” into the speaker. Happening to have been facing Tzaad, Tzaad’s tattoo suddenly intensely burned and he failed his wisdom saving, being compelled to sit on the floor suddenly. 

“What the hell!” Tzaad cried out. 

“Oh crap, I think I did that with this metal box”, Steph said.

Taking a moment to absorb the implications of this new information, they suddenly heard whirring form the control room and they were knocked off their feet as the ship jolted forward and stopped. Starting and stopping in a jerky motion. 

“Take up to get Featherwind!” Steph cried out while stumbling to her feet. 

Lurching a few more times they began descending to the ground in a spiral pattern, the bridge breaking off as they moved away. 

About 20 feet from the ground they pulled up and dropped a rope to the ground. Featherwind squawked her thanks and grabbed on, hanging there. After a few moments, Tzaad grabbed the rope and began hauling her up. After Featherwind was up, more clanking and whirring emanated from the control room and they began lurching forward again.

After a minute of lurching they began a smoother ascent away form the ship and towards the mountain range. Tzaad opened the control room finally, finding a profusely sweating and shirtless Manu, frantically working the controls, feeding fire into the balloon on top of the ship and steering them up and onward.

“We are heading to Barbaro is seems”, Tzaad told Manu and backed out again. 

Searching the ship, they find the rest of the rooms. Under the top deck in the back is a command center with a circular table in the middle, and screens showing video feeds of the angles of the ship, and a control panel for weapons. Below deck was one room full of the glass cubes from the other ship, and a bunch of rooms that seemed like sleeping quarters. 

As they crested the mountain range after about a half hour, there was an ear-splitting screech and an explosion. Running out onto the top deck, they looked back as the source of the sound and witnessed the metal ship detonating, sending a mushroom cloud of smoke and debris a thousand feet into the air. 

“I hope Oakshadow made it out okay”, Tzaad whispered to himself, as they floated into the setting star, onward in search of more answers and adventure.
