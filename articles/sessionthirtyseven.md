There was an audible pop and Dom looked around him, and down at the puddle of blood he was standing in.

“Hey, where did Mylo go?” Frain asked.

Dom sighed, “My joke wasn’t that bad!”

“Okay calm down, she does this a lot, plus this is a dream I’m pretty sure. Maybe she woke up!” Steph replied.

Tzaad sniffed the air, “Did someone fart?”

Steph darted her eyes back and forth, “Uh, it was probably Waffle. Come on, lets go!” Steph said hurriedly, walking towards the door between the statues.

“Wait!” Tzaad cried.

“What?! What?!” Steph exclaimed, raising her hands and one leg, looking around frantically.

Tzaad cleared his throat. “Allow me to check the door for traps.” 

“Why you…” Steph replied, relaxing back into a normal standing position.

Tzaad squatted and turned sideways, clapping the tips of his fingers together with his arms in the air, and crab walks over to the door, investigating it. After a few moments he stood up straight and turned towards the others. “Looks good to me!”

Everyone piled into the door and found themselves in the next room with 9 carvings in the wall with a dark hole in their gaping maws, the carvings depictions of identical demon’s heads.

Dom used detect magic, the crackle of lightning running visibly across the surface of his skin and inspected the darkness in the maws they could not see past. It revealed that the maws of the demon carvings were engulfed in illusion magic they could not penetrate.

Steph investigated the area around the door and notices most of the dragging of bodies moved across the front of all the maws up to the eighth. “I think maybe it’s the eighth one!”

“One way to find out!” Frain said, rubbing his hands together and holding them in front of him, closing his eyes and casting dispel magic on the eighth maw with a flicker of flame at his fingertips.

The darkness faded and they saw a room full of pillars through it, and screeches of pain and ecstasy beyond.

“Well, that’s ominous…” Dom proclaimed.

“I’ll check it out…” Tzaad said, crouching down and climbing through the maw as stealthily as he could.

Steph mom armed him, “Hang on, let me check for traps first.”

“Alright mom…” Tzaad agreed, rolling his eyes and stepping back.

Steph pulled a magnifying glass from a pocket near her left calf and inspected the maw for a minute before nodding. “You’re good.”

Tzaad proceeded through the maw once again and entered the room beyond. Directly ahead was a tight ring of thin pillar, packed near each out and extending in a large circle, about 60 feet in diameter. Moving to the pillars, he got a look at the center, where an altar was set into the floor, with a horrific looking monstrosity laying upon in, and a cackling mad elf covered from head to toe in blood stood over it, a knife raised.

“Wait!” Tzaad cried.

The elf, a mad look in his eyes looked up sharply, the smile still on his face. “You’re too late!” He cried, and slammed the knife down into the pitiful creature, which let out another scream.

Our adventurers were locked in battle down, the rest of the crew coming up behind Tzaad.

Four small goblin-like creatures appeared at four corners of the circle, equidistant from each other, and began to move slowly towards the altar in the middle. At the same time and Illithid, one of the others appears near one of the creatures and fixed its’ tentacled gaze upon Tzaad and the others.

“I don’t think we want those little creatures getting to the middle!” Tzaad cried out, pulling out his bow and arrow and taking aim at the small creatures.

He cut one down with a well-placed arrow.

Steph cast vitriolic sphere on the Illithid, causing 28 acid damage and burning up the small mane near it.

The Illithid flowed forward, hovering above the ground, and cast mind blast on everyone save Tzaad within its purview. Everyone was stunned for 1 minute and took 18 psychic damage.

“Oh boy, here we go again…” Dom muttered, immobilized.

Frain was able to will himself free. 

Tzaad continued taking out the manes with his bow and arrow.

Waffle nipped at the Illithid, distracting it after it latched onto Dom, getting zapped by his electric skin.

As they fought, more Illithid showed up round by round. There were four in total as they whittled away at the small goblin like manes, which had gotten up to 12 in all.

Steph cast prismatic spray, taking out large swatches of the manes and doing chunks of damage to the Illithid.

With a cry, Steph called out in elven, sweep her hands across the Illithid and casting Mass Suggestion. All fell prey to it and she bid them attack each other.

Frain watched, mouth agape, as the Illithid turned on each other and finished one another off, the final one falling dead from the exhaustion of the fight before.

Tzaad put away his bow and arrows and began to slow clap. “I have to say, just well done, Steph… Well done.”

Frain joined in, along with Dom and their claps reached a crescendo, all of them hooting and hollering.

Steph rubbed the back of her head, looking abashed. “Thanks guys, I thought of it on the fly…”

Frain took a moment to use his scry to check on Lady Innedra. He glimpsed a scene of Sauly D showing off his abs and pecs, flexing them, and Lady Innedra nodding and taking notes. Frain shook his head, trying to get the image out of it, and looked at the others, about to explain what he just saw.

Just then, the world around them seemed to… shatter, and they were surrounded by complete darkness, but could still see each other.

All around them, people flickered into existence, surrounding them. Just ahead two people stepped forward and in a familiar cockney accent, Jim belted out, “Oy, how the hell are ya?!”

 “Jim? Abel?” Tzaad asked, incredulous. “What are you doing here?”

Jim nodded and responded, “I could ask the same, but honestly, we’ve just been able to become fully conscious now. It’s like, when we’re”, Jim gestured to the surrounding people,” with you, in this place, we feel more ourselves.” He explained.

“What do you mean? What is this place?” Steph asked.

Jim nodded and continued, “Well we had a lot of time to think about it, and we’re pretty sure this is the astral plane, the realm of thought. We are connected due to being under mind control. You tied us together with your will, unconsciously at first, I think, but now we can communicate freely. We feel ourselves slipping away in the material plane, but our consciousness is fuller here with you!”

“Whoa.” Dom said. “So, you’re telling me that your minds are stuck here since you’re under the mind control of The Others in the material plane?”

“Essentially, yeah.” Jim agreed. “We’re saner with our connection. We’ve linked up more and use you guys as a conduit of sorts.”

“How can we help you?” Frain asked.

“Well, I guess it’s more how we can help you”, Jim replied. “Now that we are more aware, we can help you from the astral plane. Call upon us and we will try to help in any way we can, in your final battle. We want to help free ourselves from The Others’ thrall.” Jim explained earnestly.

“Oy, you listening?” Jim exclaimed.

Frain looked up from his task of cutting the heads off a few of the Illithid they had killed, “Huh, oh yeah, yeah, sorry. I just needed these for something… Continue!” Frain replied. 

“Right…” Jim continued, “Anyways, please don’t forget us, and please don’t kill us! We’re here, and we don’t want to do the things they are making us do! We’ll fight when the time comes!” Jim pleaded. 

Steph nodded vigorously, “We will do everything we can. We are going to fix this, I promise!”

Jim nodded, smiling, and looked around, his smile falling a bit. “Oy, wasn’t there one more of you?”

Our adventurers all shrugged in unison as they gained a level, reaching the level of 15!

Frain fist pumped as he felt the power coursing through his body, “Now that’s what I call getting a 'head' of the game!”
