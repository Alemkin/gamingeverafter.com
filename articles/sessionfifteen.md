The Order of the Polyhedron: Session 15 January 8, 2020

Alex – Dungeon Master – Manu the Monk

Ellen – Moon Elf Wizard – Steph

Dayton – Human Fighter – Tzaad

Rob – Human Cleric – Dom Strongbottom 

Dom opened his eyes suddenly as there was a violent rock underneath him and he was sent face first into the control panel to his left.

“Ah fuck!” Dom yelled, rubbing his nose and sitting up quickly, looking around.

Straight ahead of him, Manu was stumbling to his feet, holding his head. Another violent rock sent Manu sprawling onto Dom, and they were face to face on the ground.

Manu looked down into Dom’s eyes and chuckled nervously, “Oh hey, this is awkward”.

“What? Get off me and steer the ship!” Dom yelled.

Manu scrambled to his feet and went for the control panel. Pressing the button and throwing the levers, he began to crank, hoping this would help.

Below deck, Tzaad was suddenly thrown out of his bunk at another rock to the left and sprawled on the floor. Tzaad rolled over quickly, grabbed his equipment, and rolled daringly on his acrobatics check, easily balancing his way out of his room and down the hallways leading to the top deck.

Steph noticed it was a little rougher than usual as she came out of her meditative state, being jostled around in her cloud of pillows. Struggling around in the pillows and flailing her arms she didn’t make much progress in untangling herself from the pillows. Waffle sensed her distress and worked her way out of the room, Steph grabbing on as she passed and out into the hallway, heading for the disturbance.

Celestial noticed the rocking and people moving past her room and came out, following.

Tzaad opened the door to the top deck to a large, multi-pronged form on lightning in the clouds surrounding them. A sea of lighting it seemed, going on endlessly. Running over to the side in the deafening roar of the wind and lightning, he looked down to see nothing but flashes of blue ocean in all directions past the gray and clouds. He backed up and opened the control room, looking around wildly, seeing Dom and Manu.

As Tzaad came into the room, there was another rock and Tzaad was thrown into the room, and Manu was thrown left again, back on top of Dom.
 
Manu grunted and looked down, meeting Dom’s eyes, smiling shyly and saying, “We’ve got to stop meeting like this”.

Dom was almost beside himself when there was a screeching noise and a crash, followed by another rocking, sending Manu flying back off him.

Manu, Dom, and Tzaad got up and ran out onto the deck to see was the noise was coming from. Off the port side they saw a large winged creature flash pass up and out of sight. To the starboard they saw 100 feet out another with spread wings in mid flap, framed by the crashing lightning behind it. They all recognized it as a blue dragon. 

“Fuck”, Dom whispered.

The other dragon swung around the port side again within 50 feet and they were suddenly locked in combat.

Tzaad pulled out his laser rifle, prepping for combat, as Celestial and Steph came out onto the deck just in time to see the same as everyone else. Frain was brought to consciousness just in time to see the dragons on the monitors in the command center and hopped on the controls to help defense.

Tzaad shot and missed port side with his rifle. Celestial used a powered up, 4th level Melf’s Minute Meteors, sending two streaking at the port dragon, and nailing it in the wing. Steph prepared a enormous fireball and sent it flying at the same dragon, enraging it with another direct hit. Manu hopped on the starboard ballista and nailed the dragon on that side with an arrow taking a chunk out of its arm.

The dragon on port flew under the ship and up onto the starboard side, latching onto the top deck above the control room, one claw on the top deck, the other on the mid deck. It reached out with one claw, then the other, and finally snapped down with the full force of its jaws at Tzaad, who was closest, nailing him with all three hits for devastating effect. Tzaad took an enormous amount of damage, slashing, puncturing, and lightning.

Waffle darted around Tzaad and let out a roar of frost breath, hitting the dragon on its top deck claw, freezing it to the deck. Frain remotely controlled the command center top deck ballista and nailed the same dragon with another arrow.

The dragon further out swooped in to about 20 feet out and reared back, letting out a jet stream of lighting nailing Manu, Celestial, and two of the ballistae on the mid deck. 

Tzaad was losing his shit, swinging his sword around in a rage, but seeming to miss most of his hits. 

Celestial nailed the dragon latched on with another volley of meteors, tossing some inspiring words to her teammates.

Dom pulled a beautifully inspired inflict wounds on the frozen claw, maxing out with channel divinity, hitting for a staggering 50 points, rotting the claw right off the dragon.

The other dragons flew up above the balloon and out of sight, and the hurt dragon moved to the other top deck, leveling a lightning breath at Dom and nailing him.

Dom retaliated with a final blow, using a guiding bolt and blowing the head right off.

The other dragon swooped back down, getting nailed by a dart from Manu and a fireball from Steph, both having readied these ahead of time.

Wrapping this up, Steph used a terrifying Phantasmal Killer spell, projecting the dragon’s worst fear and succeeding in frightening it for a minute and dealing a good amount of psychic damage. It seemed this dragon was on it’s last dregs. Manu stepped forward and dealt a flurry of blows ending with a knock prone. The dragon unlatched and began to fall. Frain swiveled the last working ballista as it fell and finished it off with a final shot through the heart.

On it’s way by, Tzaad swiped out with his sword and took the end of it’s tail before it fell into the ocean below.

Frain was able to steer the ship out of the storm after a few minutes, and everyone breathed sighs of relief as they broke into blue sky and open ocean, away form the crashing lightning behind them.

After milling around a bit, not sure what to do, Steph spoke up, “I’m going to take a nap!”

“A… nap?” Dom asked, confused. 

Steph was already walking away, heading for her pillow room, waffle close behind.

Tzaad shrugged and picked the dragon tail up, fileting it and putting the meat aside, then brazenly whipped out his manhood to urinate on the hide to begin the tanning process. 

In her lilting, Eastern Isles accents, Celestial exclaimed, “Whoa, what the heck is this?!”

“Yep, take it all in”, Tzaad replied as the stream began to flow.

“From where I’m standing, there is not much to take in”, Celestial viciously mocked.

 Tzaad failed his wisdom save and took 4 psychic damage. Reeling from this mental blow he shames a bit and covered the sides with his hands.

“Fuck you”, Tzaad yelled back.

“Not with that thing, I’m not sure you could fuck anything!”, Celestial cut back again, with another vicious mock.

Tzaad moved into a power pose as tears began streaming down his face, trying to recover some of his pride and taking 7 more psychic damage.

Seeing this, Celestial chuckled viciously mocked again, “I guess with something like that all you have left is your confidence”. 

Tzaad narrowly avoided the damage with a wisdom roll and retorted, “Your momma!”.

Celestial laughed out loud now and viciously mocked one more time, “It’s probably the same size as the last time your mother saw it, ha!” 

Tzaad reeled back, failing another wisdom save and taking 7 more psychic damage, at the point of passing out.

Behind him, Manu began stretching and yawning loudly, obviously in immense discomfort and awkwardness, “Time to hit the hay I guess…”

Dom shook his head and asked where the princess was.

“Did I hear my name?” came a screech and squawk form the door to the below deck quarters behind them.

Dom covered himself up finally and turned around. Princess Featherwind walked out casually, as if nothing had happened earlier and walked past them looking down at the urine covered dragon hide. She casually kicked it off the side of the ship and turned around.

Tzaad was dumbstruck, unsure how to respond to losing his dragon hide.

Manu stretched again loudly, inching towards the door to the quarters.

Featherwind looked out to the horizon and squawked in surprise, pointing and said, “There, the Eastern Isles!”.

Everyone looked over and saw many islands stretching into the distance at the edge of the horizon. Featherwind explained they should dock at the shore as her kingdom is cloaked and has air defenses. They pulled in after about an hour and anchored about 20 feet from the ground, and head below deck, everyone exhausted and wanting some sleep first. They all slept straight through the rest of the day and night, waking again in the morning.

Tzaad was found coming back in the early morning, having killed a peacock and ready to skin and cook it. As he began to skin it he stared creepily at Princess Featherwind, but everyone one the ship was surely thoroughly creeped out. Everyone quickly made their way off the ship, and onto the shore below.

Featherwind lead the way squawking, “Ah I missed this place, so beautiful”.

As they walked along the snow-white sandy beach, with hundreds of years old trees lining the forest to their left, and a beautifully clear cerulean blue ocean to their right, everyone was awestruck by the beauty of it all. 

After about an hour, they came upon a set of ruins in the distance, and Featherwind squawked out that this is a scouting station ahead of the main entrance to her kingdom. As they approached however, Tzaad heard the distinct sounds of clashing steel. Coming to high alert, Tzaad ordered Celestial and Featherwind to the tree line, and the others to fall in behind him, heading towards the ruins. 

As they got closer, the sounds of steel turned to cries of pain and thudding of bodies together. They entered through the only entrance ahead of them and rounded a few corners of dilapidated walls and suddenly found themselves in a large 100-foot diameter clearing. It appeared to be a glade of sort, extremely beautiful, with all colored wildflowers and rings of multicolored stones leading to one larger stone in the middle. 

On the other end of the glade was a small party of about 5 humans, and ahead of them was not a pretty site. They arrived just in time to see the back of a paladin with long golden hair, pulling her sword out of the chest of an Aarakocra, it’s body thudding to the ground. The paladin shook the sword once to get the blood off and sheathed it.

At the feet of these 5 humans was a sea of Aarakocra bodies, what looked to be 20 to 30 of them. Some in armor, some in plain clothes, and some clearly children.

“Oh crap”, Steph whispered.

Seeming to sense something, the paladin turned back and spotted them, a wild smile on her face and a blank look in her eyes. The blank look was quickly replaced by surprise and then recognition of Steph.

Steph’s eyes widened and her mouth opened. She took a step back and held a hand to her mouth in shock. It was Annie, her big sister at the head of the party.

“Steph!”, Annie cried out as she began to stride toward our adventurers.

As Annie drew closer, Steph could see she was splattered from head to toe in blood. Annie reached them and was smiling again, clearly happy to see her little sis’.

“Wha… What is this? Why did you kill them?”, Steph asked.

Annie looked back at the bodies, then back at Steph confused and replied, “Why? Well, they are the enemy. Isn’t that why you are here?”

Tzaad stepped forward quickly, sensing danger leaking from every pore of these people, clearly a good bit more powerful than themselves, “Yes of course, we were sent by “them”, here to help, maybe make some money too!”

As Tzaad was speaking, the other 4 had moved behind them, cutting off their access to where they came in. 

Steph had moved the remote she had on her stealthily out of her pocket and attempted to use it on Annie, hitting the command button and whispering “Sleep”.

Annie suddenly doubled over in pain, clutching her shoulder. After a few moments, she shook her head and stood back up straight. 

“Sorry about that, it happens to me sometimes”, Annie said, a little dazed. 

Annie suddenly doubled over again, screaming out in pain and clutching her shoulder again. After a few more moment she stood back up slowly and looked at Steph, eyes blank once again.

“The… enemy…”, Annie slurred, slowly drawing her dripping sword and stepping towards Steph.

 Tzaad spotted Celestial poking her head in on the other entrance to the glade on the other side and yelled to everyone, “Run!”

Frain, Manu, Dom, Steph, Tzaad, and waffle were spurred into action and took off towards the other end of the glade, dodging around Annie, who was taking half hearted swiped at them, still a little dazed.

Near the middle of the glade, a rushing sound began to fill their ears, and light began to blind them to their surroundings and each other. Once moment they were running through the glade, then the next they were stumbling and tripped and fell on top of each other.


Standing up, Steph looked around, realizing they were in some kind of crystal turret house. Beautiful carving covered the walls and floors, with intricately made and decorated furniture lining the walls and floor. Sniffing the air, she noticed the smell of her favorite food was on the air. Everyone else was sniffing at the air, mouths watering as well, smelling their favorite foods. 

Dom stepped over to the only door and opened it cautiously looked out.

Ahead, where the forest was, was a large bushy wall. Beyond it was a huge, beautiful crystal palace disappearing into the clouds. To the left, where the ocean should have been, was an immense sea of beautiful, multicolored crystal of yellows, blues, oranges, reds and every other color imaginable, frozen in wave formations.

Looking up he saw the most beautiful rendition of moon and stars that he’d ever been presented with. It was the moon. And the stars. Amazing.

Behind him, stumbling into the room was Celestial, grunting as she hit the floor near them, and looking around wildly.

Steph pointed at her and asked, “Quick, what’s our snappy one liner, the session is about to end!”

Dom spoke up quickly, “This place rocks! Wait, that’s stupid, noooooo!”
