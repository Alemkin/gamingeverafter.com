Alex – Dungeon Master

Ellen – Moon Elf Wizard – Steph

Dayton – Human Fighter – Tzaad

Rob – Human Cleric – Dom Strongbottom 

Nathan – Dwarf Cleric – Frain Brightbringer

Our heroes awoke, one by one, to the sounds of sweet music drifting down the hallway. Dom, the first to rouse and get dressed, headed out into the hallway and vaguely recognized the music, but it was too far to make out fully.

Knocking on Frain’s door, Dom called out, “Hey bud, you awake? I think the party is starting…”

Frain, rolling out of bed and clanking around, got to the door bleary eyed and peered at Dom, “Alright, alright, one minute”.

After the sounds of rummaging and more banging, Frain stepped out, clothed in his usual orange/red robes. Moving together, Frain and Dom knocked on Tzaad’s door, and after a few moments he opened it up. Tzaad looked a bit bleary eyed but was otherwise fully prepared in what looked to be a military uniform, complete with an emblem of a horse aflame, with the Roman numeral V on a patch, denoting his platoon and squad. He was also wearing his white wolf mask from the wild hunt.

 “Whoa, nice threads”, Dom said, eyebrows raised.

Clearing his throat, Tzaad looked away a little embarrassed, “Uh, thanks, it’s from my squad. The servants helped me put it together last night…”

Before they could say anything else, Steph banged open her door, Waffle coming out first, followed by Steph, resplendent in a beautiful white, form fitting dress with a small train at the back, and a half mask in the form of a white wolf, her hair long down her back, showing off the shimmering emerald green of the waves, complementing Waffle’s emerald green fur.

At a loss for words, the rest of the group just gulped and nodded, and Steph led the way down the hall towards the music. As they made their way down the corridor, the music got louder until they recognized it as their group’s song. It must’ve been celestial playing! Hurrying, they headed down the stairs and behind the grand staircase to the throne room, where the music emanated, and guests were coming and going. 

They headed in and saw quite a site. On a small stage directly ahead along the right wall, celestial was strumming her lute to the tune of their theme song, and vocalizing. Along the wall to their left next to the entrance was a large buffest table. The throne on the back wall contained the princess overlooking a large cleared area in front of it for dancing where a lone figure was flying all around d the dance area. 

An arch fey,  with long, beautiful, curly black hair, and brown skin that rippled through all the shades of tree bark, covered in a form fitting gown of leaves and flowers that seemed to shed and replenish itself as she moved, was leaping and twirling and sliding around the dance floor to the beat of Celestial’s lute. 

Mesmerized, everyone watched what seemed to be the Summer Queen Titania move with a grace unknown, as the princess rolled her eyes and looked away. After a few more minutes of this, she finished up and bowed to raucous applause. She walked over to the throne and began talking to the princess, and chatter picked up from the other guests in the room, eating and talking and laughing.

Dom headed over to Celestial calling out to her, “Hey! Celestial, it’s great to see you! How did they treat you, how are you doing?”

Laughing in the same lilting accent as she talked Celestial replied, “Oh, the Summer Queen has been perfect. I was in the Emerald Forest with her until this party! By the way, the queen wants to speak with you I believe, so you should make your way over.”

Nodding, Dom thanked her and headed back to the group, relaying all this information.

“I’m hungry!”, Frain said suddenly.

At this, everyone shrugged and headed over to the buffet table. Approaching it, Dom noticed the food and drink shimmer and change before his eyes, turning into his greatest desires for sustenance. Grabbing a nice dark, local brew, he threw is back. Frain grabbed a piss beer and sipped at it.

Tzaad moved towards the table but was cut off by a tall arch fey. “Oh, hello dear, please excuse me, I’m Leylandra, Archduchess, cousin to the princess! You must tell me of your mortal escapades in combat and war. Your uniform tells me you must be somewhat acquainted with that, hmm?” 

Having said all this in one breath, Tzaad was taken aback and cleared his throat. “Uh, this is my father’s uniform, I wouldn’t know anything about that…”

Succeeding in a deception check, Leylandra smacked her lips and pouted, walking away.

Sighing in relief, Tzaad continued to the buffet table and looked for the suckling pig he had captured. Just then, the Erlking approached, smiling with his hands out. 

“Friends, how are you doing? Steph, such a breathtaking dress by the way, just gorgeous”, the Erlking said, turning and throwing a wink at Frain in between. “Now allow me to serve you, if I may have the honor?” the Erlking asked of Tzaad.

Tzaad nodded, and the Erlking cried out and pull his sword, skewering the squealing warthog, it dying on his sword and bursting open into perfect cuts of it’s meat. Pulling off a shank, the Erlking presented it to Tzaad who took it gratefully and dug in. Waffle couldn’t help herself and dug into the rest of the warthog. 

Tzaad/Dayton tossed down the rest of his piece, belting out three gnarly burps in quick succession, seemingly on command. 

Waffled stared at him and Steph elbowed Waffle giggling out, “He sure knows how to take his meat!”.

Frain and Dom did spit takes of their beer, doubling over with laughing and slapping their knees. Tzaad just shook his head.

Steph looked back at Waffle and realized there was someone petting her.

Squawking out in her high-pitched candor, Featherwind greeted them, “Hey guys, nice to see you! Especially your little dog here!”

 “She’s a wolf…”, Steph said, a little annoyed.

Shrugging, Featherwind replied, “I’ve seen bigger dogs.”

Not wanting to argue, Steph shook her head and asked, “What happened after we left, what are you doing here?”

Featherwind paused for a moment, looking as sad as her bird face can express before she replied, “My kingdom is under siege by the others. I’m here as envoy of my people, and Sagh and Manu are fighting in a final push in the material plane”.

Dom cut her off, “Wait what? Manu is out there? How long has it been!?”

“Oh well… Several moons now since I saw you”, Featherwind replied.

At this, Tzaad failed a constitution save and felt sick to his stomach all of a sudden, and stumbled out of the throne room looking for a place to vomit.

The others watched him go suddenly, Featherwind raising her eyes in question, but the group just shrugging unsure.

“It only feels like it’s been a few days here”, Frain said.

“Weird”, Featherwind replied, shaking her head. “You should probably go talk to the queen for more answers, that’s all I know at the moment”.

Out in the hallway, Tzaad stuck his finger down his throat, but passed his constitution saving throw and ended up just dry heaving over a potted plant. After a few failed attempts of this he just stumbled back into the party, pale and sweaty.

They bid farewell to princess Featherwind for now and headed to the throne to where the queen was talking with princess Dandelion. The queen turned to them as they approached, and strode forward quickly as Tzaad stumbled, catching him and stroking his hair.

As she did this, he felt a soothing warmth move through his body, and he felt a little better. The queen righted him with surprising strength, lifting him clear off his feet and setting him down again. Tzaad stuttered out a thanks, brushing himself off and clearing his throat. 

“Just one thing I want to try to address right now, I need your end of the bargain to be followed princess!”, Tzaad demanded.

The princess scoffed and looked away, “You didn’t do nearly enough…”

Looking incredulous, Tzaad took a step forward raising his finger.

The queen held up her hand, cutting off his next words. “What is he speaking of, princess?”, Queen Titania asked.

“Nothing, just greedy humans, nothing new!”, the princess replied.

Shaking her head, the queen waved her hand at princess dandelion, dismissing her. Looking like she was about to explode, the princess started rising from her throne, about to retort, but the queen shot her a steely look that made the group flinch themselves. Cowed by this, the princess huffed and stormed away and through a side door.


“I apologize for that. If I were to guess, I would say she offered to cure you of your lycanthropic affliction…”, the queen started, and continued, cutting off Tzaad before he could say anything, “But, I’m sorry to say she does not have that power and seemed to want to work through the loophole of an unknown period of tasks to never have to pay up…”

Looking sad, Tzaad said, “Okay…”

Stepping towards Tzaad, the Queen looked into his eyes, “I can help you however, as an apology. I can cure you, or I can help you control it. Lycanthropes are part of my court you know; I have several extremely powerful and gifted ones that work for me and control themselves…”

Looking at her seriously, Tzaad replied, “No. This curse, it’s cost me too much… I’ve done too much, I just want it out once and for all…”

Nodding, the Queen said, “I understand, and I can do it as soon as you know the rest. The war with the others is coming to a head in the mortal realm and we need your help. Queen Mab and myself. If you would agree, I can cure you and send you to Arctis Tor to hear her out. Before you answer, know that only she can help you with the affliction the others have laid upon you in the form of that tattoo upon your bodies.” The Queen continued. “Unfortunately, neither myself nor the princess has the power. Manu was nearly brand new to the world, and thus the curse had not fully entangled with his soul, making it a simple matter. With you I run the risk of burning your souls to a crisp along with the curse.”

Looking at each other, everyone in the group nods, seeming to agree at once if it means the end of this control over their minds and bodies.

“Will you do it now?”, Steph asked the queen.

Raising her eyebrows, her eyes widening a bit, showing off her pupils, shifting between a shimmering leaf green to a beautiful river blue and back, the queen replied, “Well, if you insist, I’m always up for the carnal pleasure of life”, and she glanced over at Tzaad, who began to blush furiously.

Steph’s mouth was agape and before she could reply, the queen continued, “I will warn you however, all of my mortal lovers have perished during the process of love making. You will have to sign a waiver of course.”

Thinking on this for a moment Tzaad began to nod and say, “Okay, I’m in!”

Steph stepped over and smacked Tzaad in the back of the head, “Stop it, you need to be cured of your curse and not die! We need to go to Arctis Tor”. 

Rubbing the back of his head, Tzaad looked abashed, “Okay, right, okay…”

The queen, eyes sparkling, chuckled and waved for them to follow, heading through the door next to the throne, and the others followed. After going down a short hallway, the queen threw open a door with a bed in the middle of the room and a few chairs scattered about. Tzaad hopped on and splayed out. The others sat in the chairs, fidgeting nervously. 

The queen walked over and held her hand over Tzaad’s head, closing her eyes and chanting softly. She began to chant softly, glowing with a soft emerald light. Tzaad began to thrash around suddenly, and the queen held him down with her other hand, chanting faster. Tzaad began to swing his head back and forth, looking down at his right arm and seeing it was furry and clawed, curling up to his chest. The queen looked locked in concentration and Tzaad let out a final scream and the Queen emanated a wave of heat and light. 

Tzaad lay there panting, no longer turning, and sweaty but no longer pale.

“I recommend some rest before you go, I’ll be just outside”, the queen said, and stepped out of the door and shut it behind her.

Talking amongst themselves, the group decided Tzaad should rest for an hour and they’ll go get ready to head to Arctis Tor. 

After an hour, everyone is packed up and ready to go, having roused Tzaad and met the Queen in the throne room. She led them out to the grand staircase and up, to the first door at the top. Inside was a beautiful forest glen, with endless sunlight and beautiful flowers, in the middle of the castle!

Stepping in, Celestial said, “Okay, time to get this show on the road!”

“Wait, what about payment from Featherwind? We did all that work…” Steph said.

“You’re seriously thinking about money form them? It’s kind of hard ot get paid by a dead kingdom!”, Tzaad said. 

“Exactly, which is why we should get paid now!”, Steph retorted.

“Okay, okay, maybe we should wait until their kingdom is secured before we start demanding some kind of recompense for her safety”, Celestial said reasonably.

Steph relented and they all stepped into the middle of the glen.

“I bid you farewell for now brave adventurers, and hopefully you may help us bring an end to this threat to us all. We’re counting on you”, the Queen said before glowing and waving her arm in their direction.

The world shimmered around the group, fading into white nothing, then black, then blue, and back into a gray of the walls of the small room they suddenly appeared in. The room was cool, seemingly temperature controlled. The color and material of the walls and one door seemed familiar, like the spaceship they had been on not too long ago. 

 Frain stepped off the small platform they were on and walked towards the door. It hissed lightly and slid open, in the same way as on the spaceship. On the other side was a slight figure in a sleek gray wheelchair, straw blond hair, and intelligent blue eyes.

Celestial recognized him immediately, her eyes widening and filling with tears. She ran over and threw her arms around him. “Michael, I didn’t expect to find you here! Guys, it’s Michael, Theodore’s husband!”

Laughing, Michael returned the hug and looked at the others. “Hey, welcome, I was sent by Queen Mab to receive you. I heard you guys were looking for me too. How’s Teddy if I can ask?” Michael asked suddenly, looking hopeful.

Looking uncomfortable, Dom said, “He’s fine as far as I remember, it’s uh, been a while since we saw him anyways…”

Looking sad for a moment, Michael looked up smiling again, “Alright well, that’s as much as I can hope to hear at least… If you guys will follow me, I’ll take you to the Queen.”

Michael pull a small level back on the arm of his wheelchair and it seemed to wheel backwards by itself, then swivel around and move forward. Dom’s eyes lit up and he jogged to catch up, “Wow, what is that? I can see lightning coursing through it! It moves on its own!”

“Pretty neat huh? I’ve been crippled for most of my life. Teddy used to help me with most tasks, the harsh world that it was to be crippled. But here it’s amazing. The doors open on their own, this chair moves me around. It’s easy to reach everything by the elevators instead of stairs… It’s like a dream”, Michael explained.

He led them through a large office area, fey lining the room in desks with devices they were typing into. Eventually they came to an elevator that he opened with a button and they all stepped in. Moving up, some elevator music began to play, and everyone stood in awkward silence on the ride up.

The doors opened to a small office, with a receptionist behind a desk that looked up and waved them in, “Please, have a seat on the sofa. The Queen is n a meeting and she’ll receive you soon. You’re her two o’ clock, right?”

Stepping in, they looked around in wonder and Frain said, “Uh, yeah, I guess. How do you know the time?”

The elf behind the desk held up her arm and pointed at her wrist, “This is a watch, it tell me the time, duh.”

“Wow… Do you have any more?”, Frain asked.

Thinking for a moment, the receptionist opened a drawer and rummaged around, pulling out an old looking version of her watch and held it out. “This is the last generation Pear, but it should still work fine”.

Frain took it and put it on his wrist, excited.

Waffle began to snoot around her desk, and she began righting the things Waffle was knocking over. “Could you please stop it?”

“II think she’s looking for treats”, Steph said.

Pulling open a drawer, the elf held out a small tin of cookie, “Peanut butter. Karen gave them to me, but she knows I hate peanut butter… You can have them”.

“God damn it, Karen…”, Dom said, shaking his head.

Waffle ate the cookies happily.

Suddenly out of a speaker on her desk a voice said, “I’m ready, send them in please”.

The elf waved them through the side door, and they headed in. It was a large office with a multipaned window behind a grand office desk that looked out on a sea of vast, snowy wasteland. Frozen forests and lakes as far as the eyes could see, a thick blizzard swirling. The outside of the castle looking to be made of grey stone, ancient in design.

Behind the desk was a plush executive chair facing towards the window. It swiveled around and sitting in it was a strikingly beautiful and severe looking arch fey, with snow white hair pulled back in a power bun. She was wearing a business pant suit, with snowflake cufflinks and icicle earrings. He eyes assessed them, shifting from snow white to glacier blue and back.

“What happened to your other appointment? I didn’t see them leave”, Frain asked.

“It was a phone conference.”, the Queen replied tersely.

“A phone?”, Dom asked. “You can talk with people outside of this room? Are you a witch?” he continued.

“Obviously”, the queen replied, standing and walking around the desk towards them. “I’m going to get right down to business, as you’re not dealing with those impractical ninnies in the Summer Court. In short, I’m sure the princess told you the information she knew was her, but she lied. It’s me who has been gathering intel on you since the beginning. Princess Dandelion is an idiot to put it mildly.”

The queen paused and looked around at them, “I also want to thank you for saving my winter knight. She is an invaluable resource that would have been quite a blow to lose.”

Looking around at each other confused, everyone looked back at the queen with blank expressions.


The queen raised one eyebrow and continued, “Milo, she was grateful for your assistance, although I’m sure she did not make that known. She is currently off on another mission, but she should be back soon.”

Comprehension dawned on everyone’s face as they realized it was the elf rogue they had let out of the cell on the air ship.

“Anyways, I wouldn’t be saying too much by saying the fate of the realm may lie on your help, and as we speak, the forces of the others threaten to work their way into Faerie, and war in the mortal realm has begun. The final war.”, The Queen said. “I’m afraid we may not be able to stop them without your help. You’ve shown a remarkable resilience and a growth in power that I had not seen before”, she continued.

“So, can you remove our tattoos?”, Steph asked.

“I can help you, but you’ll have to agree to my terms first. Simply help us end this threat, and I’ll do all I can to remove your curse and help prepare you for the coming war”, Queen Mab replied. “I give you a choice, however. I will send you back to the mortal realm right now if that is what you wish. Otherwise know you work for me to help stop them”.

Not having to really discuss, Steph speak for the group saying they might as well join.

“Good. Follow me then”, the queen said, stepping past them and out the door to the elevator. 

Everyone piling in, she hit the basement button and they descended. The elevator doors opened to a hallway. Heading down the hallways they walked into a large arena, with stadium seating that was all empty, and stairs leading up to the stands above.

“This arena is used to funnel and quell high level targets, providing a brief window to fight them cut off from their allies on the battlefield, but for now we will use it to help you fight your inner demons. This you must each do alone, and I will help the process to start”, Queen Mab explained. “Who first?”

Everyone looked at each other nervously, and Dom shrugged, raising his hand.

“Excellent, if you’ll follow me. The rest of you can head up the stairs and have a seat”, the queen said, turning and heading to the middle of the arena, with Dom close behind.

Queen Mab turned suddenly and approached Dom, putting her hand on his shoulder and closing her eyes. She glowed with a soft blue light and Dom felt an icy hand moving though his body. It stopped and seemed to grasp his heart and wrenched backwards. Dom fell to his knees screaming, and arched back, a shadow bursting from his chest. Panting, Dom opened his yes and looked up. Queen Mab was now in the stands with the rest of the group, looking down. In front of Dom were… his parent. His mom and dad, Fabio and Maya Strongbottom.

Looking around, they looked surprised, and their eyes fell on Dom.

“Mom? Dad?”, Dom asked tentatively. 

His mother started moving towards Dom, her arm out. “No, it’s just another trick”, his dad said, grabbing his mother by the shoulder and pulling her back.

“A trick? What do you mean?” Dom asked.

“I’ve seen this before… You lying demons are all the same!”, his dad spat.

“No, it’s me I swear! Where are you? What happened?”, Dom asked.

Pausing for a moment, looking suspiscious, his dad said, “We… looked. We tried… We just woke up one day and the farm was gone, you were gone. Everything was different. We wandered…” He looked away and they faded before Dom’s eyes.

Dom heard something behind him and turned, seeing his sister, Bea. “Sis!”, Dom called out, taking a step towards her.

Bea looked around wildly, eyes settling on Dom. “You… You aren’t real.”

“I just went over this, I’m real!”, Dom replied.

“Why can’t you just stay away. You’re the reason our parents left you know! Why can’t you just leave me alone!?” Bea yelled.

“No, that isn’t true…”, Dom said.

Scoffing Bea walked up and got in his face yelling, “Hah, that’s rich! It’s true and you know it!”.

Dom flinched away, turning. Directly in front of him was… himself.

“She’s right you know, she always is… You weren’t good enough then, and you aren’t good enough now. You never will be. We never will be…”, His doppelganger said. “If you were stronger you could have found them!”

“I tried my best!” Dom cried out.

“Your best isn’t good enough! It never was. Soren never taught us enough!”, other Doppel-Dom spat.

Dom stumbled back away from him and blinked. His parents were there now. His mother was on her knees, crying and crawling towards him with her hand out. Dom reached out to take her hand. 

His father yelling, “You were always an ungrateful son! You deserved what you got. Alone in the end. No friends, no family, nothing but your own uselessness!”

“Stop it Fabio!” Dom’s mother Maya screamed. 

Almost touching her hand, Maya and Fabio disappeared, replaced by Dom’s sister, Bea. “What’s wrong with you? You’ve always been this way, so closed off, weak, stupid!”, Bea continued.

“That’s not true”, Dom said, tears in his eyes and shaking his head.

“Pfft, you’re barely friends with any of them up there, if you can even call them friends”, Bea said, gesturing into the stands at the others.

“Stop it!”, Dom screamed, holding his head in his hands.

His doppelganger appeared again, “You aren’t good enough for anyone. You’ll die alone and never find your family!”

Dom stumbled up and took a swing at his doppelganger, yelling. He missed, Doppel-Dom stepping out of the way then stepping forward and shoving Dom to the ground. As he hit the ground he failed a constitution save and took 21 necrotic damage, losing 21 max hit points until his next long rest. 

Everyone was there now, his mother and father, Bea, himself. They circled Dom, yelling at him. His sister stepped forward and kicked him I the side. Dom took 32 more necrotic damage and another 32 max hit points gone temporarily.

“I wish you were never born!”, His sister shouted over him.

“I didn’t have control then, but now I do. I’ll find you I swear!”, Dom bellowed, and cast a maxed destructive wave.

Everyone stumbled back, stunned by the attack. His sister shook her head and crumbled away. Doppel-Dom had a passive look as he faded. Dom’s mother buried her face in her hands as his father hugged her and they faded…

Dom was panting on the ground, crying softly on his knees. After a few moments he stood shakily and looked around wiping away his tears. 

Suddenly there was a deafening thunderclap as a lightning bolt appeared out of nowhere and struck Dom in the chest. He felt the caress of lightning crackle through his whole body and gained Boon of the Storm. Dom now had resistance of lightning damage. Also, as an action, he could discharge himself, electrocuting all creatures within 5 feet of himself. They would take 2d6 lightning damage at the start of each of their turns, until they took an action to ground themselves. He would be able to use this only once per long rest.

Frain hurried down to Dom after this and helped him to his feet, brushing him off. They headed up the stairs together and Frain looked over at Dom.

“Hey, I figured out a great cleric group name…”, Frain began.

“Oh yeah? What?”, Dom asked a little tired.

“The A-Men!”, Frain said, smiling.
