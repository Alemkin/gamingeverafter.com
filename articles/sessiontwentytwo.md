A familiar tune drifted through the open doorway to the war room, and the group looked up to see Celestial walking through the door picking out the group’s song on her Lute. She strapped her lute to her back and grinned ear-to-ear. “What’s up guys; are we going somewhere?” she asked in her signature lilting Eastern Isles accent. 

Everyone clapped for a moment before Steph cut in, “Yeah we were deciding between a few different scenarios. They’ll catch you up, I have to go do something…”

Steph walked out past Celestial. While Steph went to bid farewell to her sister once again the group caught Celestial up.

A little while later, Steph returned to a scene of Tzaad oiling his weapon, Dom trying to figure out what powered the hologram on the table, and Frain praying in the corner silently, while Celestial lazily picked at her mini harp with her legs propped up on a chair.

Dom looked up at Steph, “I think we have decided on Haven at this point. We can’t go to Hell, and we can’t really storm their stronghold without help.”

“Alright, so how are we getting there?” Steph asked.

“No problem, I took the initiative to bring something of yours across the sea here”, Queen Mab explained, waving her hand at one fo the screen.

The screen flickered on and they could see the picture of their airship floating at the top of a mountain. 

“When you’re ready, I’ll transport you to the material plane and you can use your ship to infiltrate Haven. You see, Arctis Tor here in Faerie sits on the same mountain Haven inhabits in the material plane.” Mab finished, smirking.

Tzaad stood up, sheathing his sword and nodded, “That’s perfect, thank you. Just one question before we go, where can I get some potions before we embark on our quest?”

Queen Mab nodded and said, “We have many free amenities for our employees… Unlimited PTO,a snack station, a potion bar with an on staff barista… among others. Head over to the potion bar and you should be able to get what you need.”

Tzaad nodded in thanks and headed out with the others in the elevator and down to the main office. After a few minutes they reached a bar with an array of coffees and potions behind the bar. There was no barista to be seen, so Tzaad stepped closer and peered around. He jumped back as a small gnome suddenly popped up, grinning widely.

“Ah, ahem, greetings, I am Tzaad, and I’m here for potions”, Tzaad said introducing himself.

“Hello, my name is Zaffrab and I’m generally happy…” Zaffrab the gnome replied, slightly confused. “As for potions, do you have your scanner?”

Everyone looked at each other with raised eyebrows.

“Uh, I don’t think so”, Tzaad answered.

“Oh, no company watch or anything with your identity?” Zaffrab persisted.

Frain hurried forward holding out his wrist, “Oh I’ve got one, here!”

Tzaad nodded as Zaffrab reached out with a small metal box and scanned his watch. “Hmm, sorry this one is expired”.

Tzaad, becoming visibly annoyed retorted, “Okay… Do you take gold?”

“Sorry, we don’t believe in gold here”, Zaffrab replied with a grin.

 “Oh, for the love of She!” Tzaad yelled, throwing his hands up and storming away.

The rest of the group shrugged and bid farewell to Zaffrab, following Tzaad back to the war room and Queen Mab.

“Hey, I was wondering if you had any treasure we could have, to help us on our journey…” Dom inquired suddenly.

Queen Mab raised her left eyebrow, “What kind of treasure?”

“How about a diamond?” Dom asked hopefully.

Queen Mab snapped her fingers and a diamond appeared on the table in front of Dom.

“Awesome, thanks!” Dom exclaimed, scooping it up.

“Of course, I will grant each of your one boon. Also know that these items will be soul bound due to the nature of the magic to summon them. I’m using your soul essence to construct them.” Queen Mab explained.

“Can… can I have a diamond too?” Steph asked.

A snap later and Steph had one.

“In that case, I’ll have a rapier. I lost my last one up the ass of a giant suckling warthog… Freak accident”, Tzaad chimed in.

“Ooh, and set of chainmail for me please!”, Frain exclaimed. 

A few more snaps later and they all had what they wanted, and Queen Mab looked around at the group. “Now, are you ready to go?”

Everyone looked at each other and then back to Queen Mab, nodding.

“Perfect!” Queen Mab looked in the corner of the room and raised her hand, “Abra kadabra, alakazam!” she called out, waving her hands and wiggling her fingers.

The group heard the distinct click of a remote control before the wall slid to the side revealing an elevator. Everyone piled in and waved farewell to Mab as the doors closed. Suddenly the elevator jolted and start heading up, but began to curve to the right, and turned into an erratic zig zagging pattern, before going straight up. It picked up speed going faster and faster. Everyone rolled strength saves, but everyone was flattened to the ground of the elevator from the g forces except for Tzaad, who was driven to his knees, and Waffle, who seemed unaffected with a natural 20.

Tzaad’s shield, Hard Pass was playing “I will always love you” in a saxophone rendition as everyone struggled for breath.

As suddenly as they started, they stopped, the elevator dinging, and the doors opened, everyone tumbling out onto a snowy terrain atop the Haven mountains. Steph looked up and gasped, seeing their airship floating above them.

Everyone climbed up the rope ladder hanging off the side, Steph patting the side of the ship fondly before hopping on. They examined it, noticing blood spatter and electricity burns on the deck.

“Yep, this is the ship”, Dom said, grinning. “Now where is the pilot…”

“The pilot would be in there”, Frain replied, pointing at the front of the control room.

Frain walked over and opened the door. Inside he saw a shirtless, sweaty dwarf sitting on a stool facing the door.

“Uh, hey… Are you the pilot”, Frain asked, uncomfortable. 

The dwarf nodded slowly.

“Okay… you going to take us to Haven?” Frain persisted.

The dwarf nodded silently once more.

“Cool…” Frain said as he backed out slowly, closing the door.

The nodding intensified as he backed away.

Coming back out, Frain saw Tzaad on the bow making “pew pew” noises at one of the ballistae. They pull up the anchor and decide to head to the mountain above the red roost to rest until nightfall as it was mid-day. They took off and it was only a few hours ride until they reached the familiar peaks and touch down.

Tzaad pulled out his tentacle meat as they made a small camp and he cooked it up. Everyone took a long rest in the crew quarters and at nightfall they gathered back on the deck of the ship.

“Okay guys, I was thinking about a plan earlier. I know this spell called feather fall…” Steph began.

“Oh, you mean you want us to jump off the airship into the city!?” Dom cut in excitedly.

“Precisely”, Steph agreed, nodding. “I’m thinking 500 feet above the city I will cast feather fall on two groups, and we jump together”

After talking for a bit more, they all agreed on the plan and set off. The pilot took them over the city in the dead of the night and our adventurers stood on the deck of the ship, wind whipping their hair. Steph look at everyone in turn and they all nodded one by one. 

Steph held up her hand as her floating spell book moved in front of her hand and fluttered open, pages opening to the feather fall spell and glowing with a blue light. Steph sent Tzaad, Celestial and Frain in the first group. As they jumped, she quickly cast it on Dom, herself and Waffle next. They all went over the side and down towards the city…

Frain curled into a ball, flipping down. Tzaad pulled his sword out, head down, floating down Halo jump style yelling “Dunununun”. Waffle was doggy paddling in the air, unsure of what was going on. Steph is feet first, watching waffle and laughing. 

Tzaad veered off course a bit from the others and landed in a large field, the others landing near an abandoned warehouse next to the field. Tzaad rolled a successful stealth check after heading back to the group and snuck up on them, “I am the shadow”.

Everyone jumped at this, barely containing yells, and Steph tried to slap him, but he barely dodged whispering “Shadow” to himself. 

Suddenly out of the shadows they heard a voice with a thick cockney accent, “No, I am the shadow.”

A man with holes in his shoes, a dilapidated top hat, and a dirt streaked face smiling at them, limped out into the torchlight, “Welcome to the city, gents”.

“Ahem, who are you?” Frain asked.

“Me, the people know me as Dehbaaaatry”, Dehbaaaatry replied, bowing as low as his gout would allow.

“Uh, can you spell that please?”, Dom asked.

“Sure, it’s d-e-h-b-a-a-a-a-t-r-y”, he spelled out slowly.

“Cool”, Dom replied in thanks.

“Now, the Dame is expecting you if you’ll follow me”, Dehbaaaatry said, tuning and limping back towards the field.

Everyone followed and they got to the center of the field when Dehbaaaatry bent over and moved some dirt, revealing a small level that he pulled. Suddenly the ground beneath them began to descend in a square platform. They go hundreds of feet down before stopping, with a small door set into the dirt in front of them.

Dehbaaaatry stepped forward and opening into, leading them into a maze of tight, dirt tunnels underneath the city.

“Where are we?”, Steph asked Dehbaaaatry.

“These are one of the oil mines owned by the Oilpots. But make no mistake that the Dame of Dirt is queen here.” Dehbaaaatry explained, grinning as he hobbled along ahead of them.

“Oh right, the Oilpots, the dwarf family, right?” Dom said.

“Precisely”, Dehbaaaatry replied, nodding.

They stopped at a larger, door and walked in as Dehbaaaatry opened it, into a cavern of sorts. There was dilapidated furniture, including sofas, tables, and chairs populated with an assortment of dirty, grimy workers and vagrants playing cards or working on small projects. All was gathered around a makeshift throne with a large woman with greasy red hair, wearing a mod podge of rags as clothing. She was talking to a Drow. 

She looked up, noticing them, “Ooh’s dis den?”

“Assuming these are the slayers of the Red Roost, I present to you, the butt slayers! There were quite a few missing butts on those guards at the prison after all…” Dehbaaaatry called out.

“Whoa hang on, huddle”, Dom said as they all gathered in with Dehbaaaatry.

“I think we want to be called the A-Men?”, Frain said.

“And women”, Steph cut in, annoyed.

Dehbaaaatry nodded and turned back to the Dame of Dirt, “Introducing the A-men and Women!”

“And rapper formerly known as wolf”, Dom said, chuckling in Tzaad’s direction.

Dehbaaaatry nodded and began again, “Introducing the A-Men and Women and the rapper formerly known as wolf!”

“Right, well I can’t say I’m familiar with the A-Men and Women and the rapper formerly known as wolf”, The Dame said.

“Queen Mab sent us, she said you’d have information?” Frain inquired.

“Ah right, I’ve been expecting you lot”, the Dame of Dirt exclaimed. “I’ve got all the information in town… But it depends on what you’re willing to pay o’ course.”

“Isn’t saving the world payment enough?” Frain asked raising his arms and shrugging to the boos emanating from around them from the rest of the henchmen in the room.

“Hah, save the world… As if it would end.” The Dame sneered.

“Yeah, if the world ends, I would think it would be a problem for you too!” Dom exclaimed, pointing at her.

The Dame stood up suddenly, fury in her eyes as she stepped forward speaking passionately, “The world you know if not the world we inhabit”, she said sweeping her hands across her comrades. “We are the filth beneath your boots. We are the rats on the street scurrying below, the vermin that eat your scraps from the trash…”

“Long after you are gone, we will be here. The world only ends for your kind, not mine.” The Dame of Dirt finished. 

Tzaad held up his hands, “Fair enough, what do you want?”

“I want a particular item from the Scholar’s Spire”, the Dame began. “The Scholar’s Spire dropped it’s shields a few weeks ago after nearly 400 years of being sealed. Many went in, including my own scouts, but none have come back out. It is rumored to contain a book that contains the core weakness of your enemy, the Others. In there as well is the Onyx ring of power that I wish you to bring to me.”

“Why would we bring you the ring with this information?” Tzaad asked. 

“Because I haven’t told you everything… I have critical information about Avernus that you’ll need. And if you do this for me, you’ll gain the favor on my considerable power. I control the rats of the cities in the mountains and those of us that live beneath. I am the Dame of Dirt!”

The group huddled up and discussed, deciding to head into the tower and accept the terms.

Dom faced the camera and held up his hands, a grin on his face, “I hope we don’t ex-spire!”
