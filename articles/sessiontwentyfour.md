Looking up where The Librarian disappeared, Milo shook her head and turned back to the rest of the group, “So should we head away from the screams then?”

The rest of the group nodded in agreement and they headed forward, away from the screams. After a few minutes in this direction, among the endless bookshelves laden with books, Steph felt compelled to grab another book off the shelves.

“The Human Choice: Delectable Dishes for the Discerning Palate”, Steph read aloud slowly, trying to decipher it’s meaning.

She opened the book and flipped through. It soon became apparent that the book was filled with recipes written in Orcish, with the main ingredient being human flesh. Steph put it back randomly on a shelf, disgusted. A few moments later, she heard a scuttling from the top of the shelve, 50 feet up, and coming into view down the side was a hideous looking spider humanoid skittering on it’s eight legs towards her. Steph jumped back screaming. The arachnid stopped in the place she put the put, pick it out gingerly, shot Steph a dirty look from its many eyes, and skitter back the way they came to replace the book in its correct spot.

“Huh, nice to meet yah!” Frain called after it.

After Steph caught her breath, they moved on. Eventually they came to a split in the maze. Right, left, or forward. 

“Hey guys, look at this!” Dom called out, kneeling peering at footprints in the dust. “Footprints, all human I think, leading in all directions!”

“We should follow them!” Tzaad declared.

“Okay, but which one?” Milo inquired.

“Oh, uh…” Tzaad replied, deflating a bit.

Just then, Steph heard faint voices to the right. “There are voices that way…”

“Well, they said stay away from the screams”, Frain chimed in.

After some discussion on this point, they decided to continue forward. After a few more miles they came on a dilapidated elevator on the right up against the bookshelf. Shrugging, Frain stepped forward and pressed the button. The doors hissed open and inside was the hulking figure of a humanoid bird creature in full plate armor facing away from them.

As the door opened it looked back, blinking slowly, then took a step out and closed and locked the elevator doors behind himself. 

“Hmm…” he whispered, looking through them.

Stepping forward with heavy steps, he moved without though of them towards the bookshelves on the other side of the path. Frain and Tzaad hurried to jump out of his way.

“Hum…” the bird creature muttered, pulling a book from the shelf and flipping through it, before turning back to the others. “Interesting, level 10… I see, and you are a rogue are you Milo? Yes, this will do perfect, you shall be a good challenge. I will give you a moment to prepare yourselves…”

The bird creature straightened, putting the book back and cracking its neck and clicking it’s beak before putting a helmet over his head. 

Frain whispered out of the side of his mouth at Tzaad, “Hey, help me out here, I feel like we should split”.

Tzaad nodded and inched towards the elevator doors with Frain but tripped at the last second and fell into Frain who had begun trying to open the elevator.

“Enough of that! I gave you the chance…” the bird’s voice echoed through the helmet as he advanced, pulling a large war club and torch from his sides.

Locked in battle, everyone jumped into action. Celestial started with a vicious mockery, landing with a cruel zinger that left him slightly dazed. Dom tried and missed for an inflict wounds, leaving an opening for the knight to step in with his club, inflicting massive damage. Dom screamed out but caused his discharge one attack, dealing a large amount of lightning damage back on the Knight.

Tzaad zipped in trying to penetrate his armor but found no weakness.

“Oh crap, this guy is tough…” Tzaad muttered, stepping back.

Milo darted around behind the knight, trying to find weak links but failing to land a hit. Frain was able to land a scorching ray before the Knight sent out a fireball that engulfed the group, eating half their life in one blast.

Milo was able to find an opening and chipped away at his armor, Celestial giving back up with her signature Melf’s Minute Meteors, Steph hitting him with the arcane, and Waffle taking bites through chinks in his armor.

Tzaad yelled, coming in with a blow to the knight’s head, slamming the helmet off and sending it flying, and sending the knight to his knees, bleeding profusely from many wounds.

“Please, mercy!” the knight cried out suddenly. “I am defeated, you are the superior warriors!”

Dom, standing over the knight with his mace lifted, lowered it and looked at the others shrugging, “I’m okay with it if you are”.

Every nodded back, stepping out of their combat stances and stepping forward.

Dom looked back down at the knight, “What’s your name bud?”

“It’s… Atrophy. Please forgive me, I have the need to fight, to prove myself…”, Atrophy replied. “You see… my whole life I had trained to be the strongest knight in this realm, and for a time I was… But like all things I faded, I… atrophied. I am not half the knight I used to be a hundred years ago…” Atrophy continued, hanging his head in defeat.

“That tough, bug”, Frain said sympathetically?

“If you’ll give me a moment”, Atrophy said, struggling to his feet and heading back to the bookshelf.

Atrophy pulled the same book down and flipped through it muttering, wincing with every movement from his wounds. “I see, you seek a certain book, and indeed it is in the heart of the library…” Atrophy put the book back and turned toward the group. “I can help you with what you seek”

“Hey, can I read about myself in there”, Steph asked suddenly.

Atrophy studied her for a moment before replying, “No creature should know its own future. I suppose you could read it, but I fear it would destroy you…”

“Oh…” Steph whispered back.

“If you’ll step into the elevator, I will send you to a small town not far from here. The people there know something of the Heart. They are an old people with much wisdom. But with that time comes ignorance and insolation that may be hard to struggle. Find yourselves and you’ll find what you seek…” Atrophy explained. 

Nodding their thanks, everyone stepped into the newly unlocked elevator. Atrophy waved goodbye, wincing again as the doors closed. 

Just before they closed all the way, Dom called out, “Looking strong bud!” and cast Prayer of Healing on the group, including Atrophy. 

The doors closed and the elevator jolted to the right, heading in the direction they were headed before, at a faster speed. After about 10 minutes of swift speed, twists and turns, the elevator slowed and came to a stop, opening its doors as everyone stepped off.

Dom took a few steps forward, noticing an opening ahead that seemed to lead into a more open space than just the towering bookshelves around them. It looked to be a small town with houses made of stacked bookshelves.

“You guys seeing this?” Dom asked the others.

As he turned his head, he caught a glimpse of a figure peeking around the corner of the entrance to the town. As their eyes met, the figure leapt out, eyes widening, and Dom saw it was just a kid with something across his forehead.

“Hey bud, it’s alright, what are you doing out here?” Dom called out in question.

The boy shuffled his feet, looking down at the ground, “Are you guys adventurers?”

“Yep, that’s us!” Frain called out, “And we’re nice!”

The boy’s eyes began to sparkle, and a smile lit up his face, “Nice adventurers!” The boy darted forward towards Dom and latched on to his leg before looking up. “Cool, where did you come from? Where are you going? Have you killed a lot of people? Can I come?”

“Whoa, slow down there”, Dom said chuckling, peering down at the kid.

Across the boy’s forehead he noticed was the word “GLUE” in bold letters, seemingly tattooed there.

“Is your name glue?” Dom asked the boy.

“Yeah!” The boy yelled, eyes widening in wonder. “How did you know?!”

“Just a wild guess”, Dom replied, shrugging with a grin on his face.

“Come on, let me show you guys my town! It’s called The Fringe!”, Glue blurted suddenly, and hopped off Dom’s leg, running over to Frain and grabbing his index finger before pulling him along to the entrance.

Glue leading the way, the others followed, and they entered the neatly rows houses of a bookshelf neighborhood.

Glue pointed to the left and right as they passed houses, “That’s where my cousin, Sorrow lives. Oh, and that’s Pride’s house! Ooh, and that’s where Mayor lives… He’s the Mayor of the town!”

After a few minutes of this, Milo slowed as she noticed a figure huddled in an alley on the right, clutching her knees. “Hey, who is that?”

Glue stopped and looked over, “Oh, that’s just Murder. We don’t talk to her”.

“Why not? Is it because she murdered someone?” Steph asked.

“No silly, that’s just her name. We don’t talk to her because her name is Murder, duh!” Glue said, exasperated. “She mostly wanders around, but we’re just supposed to ignore her!”

“Oh, that’s terrible…” Celestial whispered.

“Hah, you’re silly” Glue replied, before pulling Frain ahead, and the others followed, Steph glancing back at the huddled Murder one last time before moving on.

 “Hey, where is everyone?” Tzaad asked glue.

“Oh, everyone is sleeping! It’s late!” Glue replied as they entered what looked like a town square.

“Have anywhere for us to stay? A Hard Journey in perhaps?” Dom inquired.

Glue stopped and though for a moment, “Well, you can stay behind the town hall over there!”

Everyone agreed and they headed that way, leaving Glue behind.

“Wait, promise you’ll come back?!” Glue called out.

“We promise!” Dom called back over his shoulder.

The group set up a small camp, Steph casting her Ward of Disinterest to avoid being snuck up on. Tzaad worked on his weapons, and Celestial plucked out a slow, melancholic tune on her mini harp. Frain headed to the side of the camp to get in a quick prayer to Kossuth.

“Mind if I joined you bud?” Dom questioned Frain.

Frain shrugged and nodded, “It’s a job well suited for the A-Men after all!”
