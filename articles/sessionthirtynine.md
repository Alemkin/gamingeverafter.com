Dom stared at Tzaad with flat eyes. Tzaad looked up at him and raised his eyebrows, shrugging. “What”?



Dom shook his head, clearly annoyed at being one-upped on the pun game, and said, “Where are we going next?”



Steph raised her finger and replied excitedly, “The library, to collect some information! Oh, and your parents, Dom!”



Dom nodded in agreement and turned to exit Fantasy Costco.



“Wait!” Steph cried.



Dom jumped and twirled, his hands raised, ready to karate chop, “What!? Where!?”



“We have to do a team hi-five first.” Steph said seriously.



“I... What?” Dom asked, confusing marring his tone.



Tzaad smile and held up his hand, “On three! One... Uh.” Tzaad trailed off, forgetting what comes after one.



Frain cried, “Three!” and went in for a hi-five with all his dwarven might, which wasn’t anything to sneeze at in his stocky, dense frame.



Tzaad blinked and stepped aside, and Frain missed, eyes widening as he careened into a nearby shelf full of greeting cards. Frain shook his head, standing up and brushing himself off. He looked up and noticed everyone was leaving and hurried to catch up.



“I uh, meant to do that...” Frain muttered sullenly.



Everyone stepped into the freight elevator and Steph hit the library button in the shape of a book, and it rumbled into motion, taking them up until it opened into a small sitting room with several doors labeled in ascending order of letter, and a few bookshelves and benches.



Mylo stepped in first, looking around the small rectangular room, and investigated the small letter plaques at the side of the doors. “So uh, which one?”



“What were those things called again? That we are fighting?” Frain asked.



“Illithid, I think...” Mylo replied. “So, I guess the ‘I-N’ door?”



“That makes sense to me”, Steph replied, shrugging and stepping forward to open the door. She peeked her head in and looked side to side, taking in the seemingly endless shelving containing more book than she’s ever seen in her book. Steph’s eyes sparkled, “I bet there are a lot of spells I could learn in here...” she muttered to herself.



Mylo brushed past Steph, shaking her head and looked around. Suddenly, the hairs on the back of her neck stood up and she twirled around, glimpsing a shadow disappearing around the corner of a bookshelf 50 feet away. Mylo’s eyes narrowed as she took off after the shadow and turned the corner, only to see the shadow disappear around the next corner down the hallways of bookshelves another 25 feet down.



Mylo looked back at the others who had piled in and whistled, jerked her head down the way the shadow had gone.



“What, what’s wrong?” Dom asked.



Mylo jerked her head again down the hall, and looked back and forth, rolling her eyes in the same direction.



“Are... Are you okay? Does your neck hurt or something? I...” Dom continued before being cut off.



“For the love of She, this way! I saw something this way you dunce!” Mylo blurted out annoyed.



Dom raised his hands and turned away, “Okay, you’re clearly upset right now, I’m just gonna give you a second.”



Tzaad shrugged and hurried over to Mylo and looked down the way she was facing, “Right or left?”



“It went right.” Mylo replied, eyes hardening again, her body tensing for action.



Tzaad nodded and snuck down the carpeted floor and peeked around the corner of the bookshelves, down another hall of bookshelves and saw nothing. He looked left and didn’t see anything but more books. He stood up straighter an walked down the right.



After a few seconds his senses tingled and he spun around, coming faced to face with...  The Librarian, the orangutan from their adventure in the Spire. Tzaad yelled and jumped back, raising his hands for a karate chop once more. Everyone else rushed around the corner at his yell and saw the scene.



“Ook”, the Librarian said in greeting.



Mylo walk up and leaned against one bookshelf with one foot up behind her and crossed her arms. “Ook” she replied, nodding.



Steph looked at Mylo. “Well, what did he say?”



Mylo raised her eyebrows and replied, “Oh right, he just said welcome friends to the library, it is good to see you again. What brings you to this vast bastion of knowledge once more?”



“Oh, is that all?” Steph asked, brows raised.



Mylo shrugged and shook a strand of hair out of her face, “I’m paraphrasing really, a lot of what he says is just fluff.”



“All he said was Ook!” Frain blurted out, looked a little crazed.



Steph raised her hand to cut Frain off, “Enough. Nice to see you again Mr. Librarian! We were hoping to find out more about the Illithid! We need to stop them...”



The Librarian straightened up, his wrinkly orangutan lips pressing together, and his bulging orangutan eyes hardening. He nodded and said, “Oook.”



Everyone looked to Mylo and she translated, “I knew this day would come, follow me fair adventurers and we shall uncover the information you need to complete your quest.”



Frain shook his head as the Librarian took off down the maze of bookshelves. He looked at everyone else and took off after him, everyone following shortly after.



The Librarian hopped on rolling ladders attached to the bookshelves, pull himself along at breakneck speeds until he came to a corner and hopped off to another ladder. The group struggled to keep up.



After minutes of this, The Librarian came to a sudden stop and hopped off the ladder, ambling over to a row of book two shelves up and thumbed through. Everyone else came up behind, breathing heavily and struggling to catch their breath. Waffle shuffled over to the Librarian and snooted his ears.



The Librarian giggle and swatted Waffled hulking figure away. “Ook...” he said in concentration.



Mylo was translating on auto pilot now. “Please don’t distract me, I am trying to find... Aha!”



The Librarian turned, holding up a book, “This is a compendium of known strengths and weaknesses and well as some other assorted knowledge. I will be honest with you, there isn’t a lot of knowledge on them.”



Steph perked up, “Yes! What are they weak to?”



The Librarian replied, flipped through the pages, “Well unfortunately, not too much, well nothing in particular to be fully transparent. You’ll want lots of resistant to charm and stun...”



“Oh”, Steph replied, deflating.



“What do they find distasteful?” Frain asked. “Perhaps a severed head of their brethren?”



The Librarian scratched his orangutan chin for a moment, “It is quite possible. I would guess at anything as an affront to the mind as well.”



“Maybe alcohol?” Dom added.



“Clever!” The Librarian proclaimed. “It inhibits cognitive processing, very distasteful!”



“So... we get them drunk?” Steph asked.



“No, we get drunk!” Dom replied.



The Librarian raised his bushy orangutan eyebrows, “Perhaps it would help defend against mind blasts... But you would be drunk...” He turned and put the book back on the shelf, and turned back, straightening his ascot.



“What about life history maybe. Where do they come form, what do they believe in?” Steph asked.



The Librarian nodded and turned back to the shelf, scratching his wrinkly orangutan chin and furrowing his brow. He turned back suddenly and held out his large, orangutan hands. “There appear to be a book missing and I... don’t know where it is. I’m sorry. It was ‘A Brief History of Tentacle-ly Kind’ by Durple Moistface.”



Suddenly his gaze snapped up and he titled his head, listening. “I... feel someone calling, excuse me for now!” He turned and hopped on the nearest rolling ladder, pulling himself along at superhuman speed and around a corner and out of sight, throwing one last “Ook” over his shoulder.



“What did he say?” Tzaad asked.



Mylo cleared her throat, having paused for a moment, “He said... Of course, Remember that words have power, and if you ever need me or find yourself in dire trouble, I will be there, for I am... The Librarian!”



“Well, that was... Informative?” Tzaad asked.



“I...” Steph began before she spotted a cat sitting at the corner the Librarian disappear around. “Wait, a cat... There!” She said, pointing.



Frain simply took off, running as fast as his short legs would take him towards the cat. The cat turned quickly and took off. Dom looked at Mylo and shrugged, taking off too and everyone else followed.



They weaved through the maze of bookshelves, having completely lost their sense of direction a while ago, before the cat finally disappeared under a couch in a reading nook halfway through one of the hallways.



Frain rushed up to the couch and heaved it away with unnecessary force, revealing a set of stairs leading down. He shrugged and walked down, with the others following.



At the bottom of the stairs was an old wooden door that Frain threw open, revealing a. Room full of cats in tired seating in an octagon surrounding a small stage down the tiered stairs in the middle.


A small black cat with white paws and marking look up at them from the stage and spoke, “Greetings friends, and welcome to the Congress of Cats. I am Asparagus Whitesocks, and I am the First Speaker of this House. I ask the House now – do you welcome these outsiders?”



A chorus of yowls, mewls and hisses drifted from around the large warehouse like room, most of the hisses being directed at the hulking form of Waffle, the winter wolf.



A small tabby bounded up to Steph and weaved around her legs and the others chattering excitedly, and they recognized Bombalina. “Oh my, friends, hi! I talked with with the Coral Court, and the Erlking and...”



Mylo laughed and reached down, trying to pick up Bombalina for a hug, succeeding at her dexterity check and scooping her up into a nuzzle.



Asparagus chuckled from the stage and spoke, “Anyways, for the order of business, we brought you here to coordinate our efforts in retrieving your allies. Bombalina here convened with the Coral Court and the Erlking. Griddlebone with the Church of Kossuth and your people, Frain. Bartholemew, our King, with the Dame of Dirt and various others.”



Griddlebone wandered up to Frain and spoke in his grinding voice, “The people of Kossuth they are particularly stubborn and need specifics...”



Frain nodded, “Yeah we should tread carefully with favors form my people, we want to avoid a... cat-tastrophe...” Frain held his hand over his mouth, concealing his laugh.



Tzaad looked weird and held his side, wincing as if he had been dealt a blow.



Griddlebone’s eye twitched and he continued, “What are my orders beyond this.”



Dom cut in, “Ooh, maybe search for this book that is missing, something is... fishy about it being gone.”



Frain clamped another hand over his mouth.



Tzaad doubled over.



Steph nodded, “It’s called A Brief History of Tentacle-ly Kind, by Durple Moistface.”



Griddlebone nodded, and looked at Frain before shaking his head and stalking off.



Frain removed his hands from his mouth and called out, “Hey, no need for cattitude!”



Dom slapped his knee and laughed.



Tzaad cried out and arched back, falling to the ground, having taken 12 d6 of psychic damage from the onslaught of puns. He seized on the ground, his scarf coming unraveled revealing his neck tattoo that read ‘Not a Baby Killer’ across his throat.



Frain bent over Tzaad and pulled him to his feet. Tzaad shook his head and looked back down at the stage to Asparagus.



Bartholemew, the King of Cats, cleared his throat and spoke, “The Dame of Dirt will not help, and I could not find Tesseract, you will have to contact him.”



Asparagus nodded and added, “Giggle and Atrophy can be of assistance as needed, and we will need to know the status of Annie, The Hellriders, and Murder and Saline.”



Steph nodded, “Wow, you are all such good boys and girls. So smart gathering all that info and allies. Thank you so much!”



Bombalina bounded around he legs again excited.



“You know, in all the excited I forgot to ask about Manu, where is that son of a gun?”



Manu stepped forward from beside the group, “I’m right here, been with you guys the whole time...”



Tzaad jumped for a third time in as many hours, going into karate chop mode and yelling out, “Ah, oh man, how do you do that?”



Dom scratched his chin. “Uh, which Manu are you, I’m losing track here.”



“What, are you kidding me...?” Manu began, “I’m the last clone... Manu prime disappeared into the time rift and went back 400 years, remember, and you guys found me at the top of the space shuttle.... Tzaad, you rescued me from the clone tube and blew the ship! I’ve been with you since then, except well I fell off the parapet at the battle of the Eastern Isles and was nursed back to health by the Coral Court. But around that time the first Manu clone was retrieved from hell by Mylo I believe...” Manu explained in one breath.



Dom’s eyes glazed over, “Yeah well... That clears it up I suppose...”



Asparagus cleared his throat, “As we have other matters to attend at our Congress, esteemed guest, we bid you farewell and will convene again for final preparations before our next journey!”



Steph nodded and turned back to the door, heading out with everyone else following.



Upon ascending the stairs and exiting from the trap door, they came out into the West Tower, where their normal residence was.



Dom blinked and turned to the others. “You know, I was just thinking about the legendary instrument we got in Hell. Can that help us?”



Steph explained about the Fochlucan Bandore, “It’s really only from bards, so perhaps it has some spells that might help if Celestial uses it! Like maybe this Protection from Evil and Good spell?”



“Ooh yes, that might help”, Dom agreed.



“What about tinfoil hats?” Tzaad asked.



Steph ignored him, “Well we have the Astral Plane as well, so perhaps there are spells we can call upon from our mind-controlled allies in there.”





Dom nodded and turned to leave, “I have something to take care of before we turn in for the night...”



“Hang on bud, I’ll come with you!” Frain said.



“Same.” Mylo said and walked over to his side, smirking.



Dom nodded and started walking, heading to the non-denominational church.



An elevator ride and several twists and turns later, they arrived and he looked up at the impossibly long sign reading, “Non-Denominational Church of these open offices the welcomes all faiths and customs to practice, or don’t as they see fit without infringing upon other’s culture or privacy”



Frain raised his eyebrows, “I feel like this could’ve been done better...”



Dom peeked in and spotted Maya Strongbottom, his mother, sweeping in the corner. He smiled and walked in and over to her, the others at his heels, and stopped near her, waiting for her to finish up.



Maya looked up and smiled before her eyes widened when she realized who she was looking at. “Dom, is that you? My baby boy? I... We got your letter when we got back...” Her eyes filled with tears.



“Yeah, it’s me, mom. And I’m a man now, I have a beard!” Dom replied holding his arms open.



Maya let out a sob and rushed forward, pulling into a fierce hug and crying into Dom’s chest. Dom closed his eyes for a moments before opening them again and asked, “I want to know what happened 10 years ago. Why did you and Dad disappear?”



Maya pulled away and looked up into his face. “We were taken... You and Bea were playing in the forest as usual when they came... They enslaved us. We made them believe we were the other ones so they wouldn’t get you and your sister...” Maya explained. “We were in this dark cave system, it was awful, always dark and damp! We would use the walls for guidance, those creatures didn’t seem to need any light...”



“How did you end up in hell?” Dom asked.



“Well...” Maya began, “They used us for hard manual labor, day and night, and when you couldn't any more, they sent you to the hell wars as fodder... A front line to protect them as they fought...” She shuddered. “Fabio, you father, pretended he couldn’t go on either when I collapsed, so we wouldn’t be separated... But luckily Lt. Mal and the Hellriders, they saved us, and we were locked away in the tomb until you found us!”



Dom nodded, “I’m sorry that happened to you and dad... but you’re safe now. It’s not over, but we’re going to go kill the guys that did this. We’re gonna make it safe for everyone, mom. I promise...”



Dom nodded at his companions, “These are my friends, Frain and Mylo, and they’re gonna help me do it.”



Maya looked over at Mylo and held out her hands walked forward and holding her gently by the sides of the face and kissing her on either cheek, “Que bonita! My dear, you’ll make such a wonderful wife for my little boy!”



Mylo sputtered, at a loss for words.


Maya pulled back and turned to Dom, “I wish you father were here now. He would be so proud of the man you’ve become. I know I am, and I love you.”



“I love you too... Mom.” Dom said, tearing up a bit.



“Where is your sister, Bea?” Maya asked, her brow furrowing.



“I... don’t know. She went with a foster family when she aged out of Soren’s care, but I’m sure she’s still on the continent. We can find her together when this is all over!” Dom replied, grabbing and squeezing Maya’s hand.



Maya smiled and went in for another hug, applying all her strength into a bone crushing hug that left Dom gasping for breath. She pulled away again, reluctantly and slapped Dom on the chest, nodding.



Maya looked up into Dom’s eyes one more time before going in for another, softer hug, and they stayed like that for just a little while.
