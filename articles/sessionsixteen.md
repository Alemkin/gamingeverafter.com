Stumbling back in, Dom excitedly tried to explain what he saw outside. Everyone was a bit dazed and confused, but Tzaad managed to stumble to his feet and stagger over to the door. Swinging it open again, he stuck his head out and saw an imposingly large wall of leave, about 100 feet high, not 30 feet in front of him. Tzaad blinked and closed the door. Then he opened the door again and saw the same thing. Tzaad began to open and close it rapidly. After a few times, when he opened the door again, he witnessed a procession of people going by the door, a festival where everyone was in masks. 

Dom walked out and flagged one down nearby, “Hail and well met!”.

Stopping suddenly and slowly turning, the tall figure peered at Dom through the eyes of the mask.

“Fascinating”, the figure said, pulling up his mask and leaning in closer.

Under the mask it was revealed to be a true elf, one of the Fae people. The true elf poked and prodded Dom in a few places and laughed excitedly.

“Stop hey, that tickles!”, Dom yelped in between giggles.

Smiling, the true elf put his mask back on a turned to walk away. As he walked away, a much shorter figure in a mask stopped and walked over, pointing at Dom.

“You’re not wearing a mask!”, the true gnome exclaimed.

“I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask for a song to proceed!”, he continued.

Several the other figures in the festival stopped as well, gathering around and clapping their hands chanting, “Song, song, song!”.

Tzaad stepped forward and cleared his throat and proceeded to sing of his bloody adventures thus far, “I… Uh, allegedly killed a baby, and that was definitely not me maybe. After that I killed some guards! Okay it was more than some! From there escaped to the mountains, and boy was it fun! Up there I met the grandpa of the little baby ooh, and I killed that old man too!”.

Dumbfounded, the rest of the group stared at Tzaad and his song. The rest of the audience cheered and clapped calling for encore.

Steph cleared her throat as well, deciding to throw her hat into the ring, “Uh… I joined this group sure what to expect, and come to find it’s quite suspect… My sister was scooped up too, and I don’t know what to do…”. 

Steph trailed off sadly, and everyone paused for a moment taking it in, before applauding again. The group of onlookers began to move on back into the festival. 

The group decided to move back into the turret house after dealing with that odd set of events and talk about what to do next. After a bit of discussion, they decided to explore a little bit. Dom moved back to the door and opened it again. This time however, he saw a narrow hallway, resplendent in white marble and crystal. Mouth open, he carefully moved into the hallways and looked around. The rest of the group followed, and they went until there was a right turn, and in front of them lay a large ornate crystal door. Opening it, they found themselves in a large throne room, and upon the throne a small figure lounging looking bored.

“Hail and well met!”, Frain exclaimed, stepping forward.

Looking over in their direction, the figure’s eyes lit up and she smiled, beckoning them in, “Come in, come in, I don’t have all day!”

Everyone entered at her behest and the figure giggled and clapped her hands, jumping up and down.

“Uh, okay, hi my name is Frain, and this is Dom”, Frain said cautiously, gesturing at Dom.

“Yes, and you all are Steph, Tzaad, Manu, Celestial, and little Waffle!” she continued for them excitedly, pointing them out one by one. 

“I know all about you and your adventures! I’ve been following them with bated breath since Graymoor! I know this may be confusing, so let me introduce myself. I am Princess Dandelion, the Summer Lady of the summer court of Faerie, and this is my dominion, The Hedge Grove. You are in the land of Faerie, one side of the coin of the material plane, and I nudged you along in here when you crossed veil!”, she continued without breathing.

At a loss for words, nobody moved or said anything. The princess nodded and called out, “Sagh!”.

After a few moments, a door next to the throne opened and Sagh walked through. Recognition rippled through the group as they remembered meeting this hulking 6’ 6” half-orc in Graymoor on their very first adventure together. She was dressed in intricate golden plate armor cover her from chest to toe, a helmet under her right arm, and a magnificent set of sword and shield strapped across her back. 

Sagh closed the door behind her and looked back at the group and smiled. “It’s you guys!”

Steph stepped forward asking, “Sagh, hi, how are you, what is this place, why are you here, why are we here, what’s going on?!”

“Whoa, slow down, I’ll explain in just a moment”, Sagh responded, side eyeing the princess, who was sitting back in the throne, watching with interest.

Clearing her throat, Sagh began, “Okay, the short of it is, when you left, Graymoor began to change quickly. People began to disappear and those that were left, began to act strangely. I found these odd polyhedron tattoos on a few that hanged themselves in their homes.”

Steph gasped at this, and Sagh continued, “Yeah, it was time to get out of there. It was hard since I owned half the town and it was home, you know?” Sagh paused for a moment looking tired and sad. 

“Anyways,” she continued, “I escaped one night into the forests of the mountains with Henriette, and we wandered and camped for a week or so in the snows before coming to this grove that was free of snow, and covered in beautifully green grass and flowers, and we wandered around in it when we suddenly found ourselves in the Emerald Forest. Well at least I know that’s what it is now, but it is where Queen Titania, the Summer Queen and Princess Dandelion’s mother rules.”

“Wait, hold on”, Tzaad interrupted, “You’re telling me there is a Summer Faerie queen, and she’s in the mountains?!?” Tzaad asked, obviously a little confused.

“Well, yes and no. She exists in Faerie, in parallel to the material plane where we are from”, Sagh responded.

Tzaad nodded, obviously not connecting anything but pretending to understand.

 Sagh continued, “Well, I met with the summer court at a moment of contention, when their last Summer Knight had been killed. Long story short, I went through a series of trials and was dubbed the new Summer Knight, a mortal champion of the Summer Court of Faerie, and I handle all their mortal concerns as they can’t interact directly with the mortal world.”

“Okay, hang on, so this is Faerie and there are a bunch of courts. What are the rest?” Frain asked.

Sagh explained they were in Faerie, and there were several courts. The Spring Court, Summer Court, Fall Court, and Winter Court, along with some lesser ones like the Coral Court of the crystal sea. Queen Titania of the summer, Queen Mab of the winter, The Pumpkin King of the fall, and a coalition of rulers of the Spring court, including Eachthighern the Lord of Unicorns and The Most Ancient, the Treant progenitor, among others. 

“Okay, enough of this”, princess Dandelion cut in, “I want you to do some things for me, but not right now. However, just so I have your attention”, she continued as she stood up and suddenly appeared behind Tzaad.

The princess sniffed him, giggle and whispered, “My little lycanthrope”, and appeared by Manu, touching him in the chest and a blinding flash of light a heat, blinding everyone momentarily went off.

When the light retreated, Manu was standing there completely naked, eyebrows singed off, looking dazed. He quickly covered himself up, yelping and looking around embarrassed. Steph stepped forward, surprised and handed him her cloak to cover up. He took it gratefully, but it still left one of his legs fully exposed. As she handed him the cloak, Steph noticed his tattoo was missing, completely removed.

The princess giggled and appeared back on her throne looking down at them.

“I hope that gained your attention, and just know there is more where that came from if you please me!” the princess called out.

Tzaad stepped forward, noticing the tattoo gone, “Wait, and forgive me for being so forward, but can you help me with my lycanthropy? Get rid of it I mean!”

Dandelion took a measure of him for a moment then smiled, “Oh yes, I think it’s quite possible. But only after you help me out”. 

Tzaad nodded and stepped back.

“You may go now,” the princess said as she made a shooing motion.

Sagh shook her head and sighed, turning towards the door next to the throne and beckoning for everyone to follow. And so, our adventurers followed, unsure of what else to do. Sagh lead them down another crystal and marble hallways to a comfortable looking wooden door with a carving of a mermaid on it. Going through they found themselves in a huge Spa and bathhouse. Tzaad rushed to the poolside and unzipped, preparing to relieve himself.

Sagh grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him around, “Not here you dolt, over there”, she said as she pointed over to a doorway leading into the restrooms.

“Oh, right, I knew that!” Tzaad proclaimed and rushed off to the toilet. 

Waffle barked and jumped into the spa, and swam around, clearly enjoying herself. Steph sat by the edge and watched her. Dom came back from the toilets and commented on the luxuriousness of the bidets.

“I swear, my butt has never been cleaner. They really are amazing!” Dom gushed.

Sagh pulled Frain aside while everyone relaxed for a bit, “Don’t think I forgot about you hurting Henriette back in Graymoor. I expect an apology.”

Frain thought hard for a few seconds before remembering cutting Henriette with a silver blade without her permission, checking if she was a werewolf then nodded, “Fair enough”.

Sagh, satisfied, nodded and let it go. Tzaad came back in time to see Waffle stepping out of the pool, shaking off and gaining +5 temporary hit points. As her tongue lolled out, Steph watched her two canines fall out, only to be replaced by two more, much large and sharper, almost shark like teeth. Waffle didn’t seem to notice.

Tzaad, amazed by what he saw, and confused about what was causing what, ran back to the toilets. After a few moments he came back.

“Guys, wows, those spouts of water in the toilets are a really magical experience. My butthole has never been cleaner, and wow I feel great!”, Tzaad proclaimed.

Everyone paused, looking at Tzaad, then burst out into laughter. Tzaad joined them and together they let it all out for a few minutes, almost rolling around with laughter.

As they calm down, a hand comes out of the water, stroking the fur on Waffle’s back who was sitting near the edge. Out of the water, following the hand, popped a woman. She looked familiar and when she sat up on the edge, showing a long fin identifying her as a mermaid, everyone recognized Sereia! It was the mermaid they helped free back in Haven at the carnival! 

“Sereia!” Frain cried out, “good to see you!”

“You as well”, she replied. “I’m here on behalf of the coral court, but boy and I glad to see you guys. I’m forever grateful for your help of course!”. 

After catching up a bit, Tzaad stepped forward and asked, “What can you tell us about where we are, what do we do?”. 

“Well, you are in the domain of the Summer Lady, she is an Arch Fae and immortal, so I would suggest following instruction for now, but they aren’t so bad once you get to know them, just a little over zealous. Whatever you do, however, don’t make deals with the Fae, they are notoriously cunning and will find and loophole left. Best to just be safe.”, Sereia explained.  

Tzaad, having grown bored, cannonballed into the pool, coming up from underwater, but finding himself in a fountain in the courtyard of the castle, then going underwater again and breaking back up again, finding himself back in the pool, and struggling out of the water startled. At least he got +5 temporary hit points from it, and a new set of mirror freckles. 

Sereia giggled and bid farewell to everyone, before disappearing under the water again.

“Okay, if you are all rested up, it’s time to go. I’m sorry about this but the princess wants you out in the hedge grove for a while and she will find you when she’s ready.” Sagh explained as she led them out and down the hallway. 

Sagh pondered a moment and open a door on the left. A set of tentacles came squirming and screaming out, and Sagh yelled, struggling to close the door, jamming them back in.

“Whoa, sorry about that guys, wrong door”, Sagh panted.

Opening the next door, they saw it led back out into the hedge grove, and she beckoned them out, holding Manu and Celestial back.

“Celestial is need for some entertainment, and Manu needs to rest”, Sagh explained.

Celestial nodded, “It is okay, I will see you later. It seems my fame knows no dimension!” Celestial exclaimed, smiling widely. 

The door closed, and Tzaad, Frain, Dom, and Steph looked at each other and shrugged, moving down the hedge maze. Looking around, they found a shoppe named Curio Dealers, and across from it a Hard Journey in.

Tzaad turned to the others, “I’ll meet you guys at the Hard Journey in, and we can sleep it off, I need to get something first”, he explained, then turned and went into the Curio Dealers shoppe. 

Steph and Dom headed into the Hard Journey Inn and got a couple of rooms, moving upstairs to retire, and Frain joined Tzaad in the shoppe. 

Tzaad, walking in saw shelves stacked with junk floor to ceiling forming a sort of maze inside the shop. From the back somewhere he heard a bored voice, “Hey, welcome to Curio’s Curiosities, I’m Jacqueline, what do you want?”

“Uh, a rapier if you have it. I’m sorry, where are you?” Tzaad replied, looking around confused.

After a few moments and banging, a true gnome came burrowing out of the junk to his left and looked up at him.

“A rapier you say. I got one around here somewhere.”, Jacqueline said, and went off, coming back with a rapier. “75 gold please”, she continued.

Tzaad choked on spit and hacked a bit, “What?! Wait, surely there is something else you would take.”

“Well, there is something”, she thought, eyeing his mid-section curiously. 

“I’ve always wanted to poke the belly button of a mortal”, Jacqueline said casually.

Tzaad sighed and pulled up his shirt, “Go ahead”, he said.

Poking his belly button, Jacqueline giggled and nodded in satisfaction holding up the rapier. 

“If you let me poke you with the rapier, I’ll give you an upgraded rapier”, Jacqueline offered.

Thinking for a moment, working the small gears of his mind for a moment, Tzaad agreed and closed his eyes. Jacqueline giggle and held up the rapier, aiming it at his belly button, and poking through to the spine. Tzaad cried out in agony, taking 25 points of damage. Nodding and giggling in more satisfaction, Jacqueline turned back and did something, turning back and handing Tzaad the rapier.

Looking down through streaming tears, Tzaad saw a dagger duct taped to the hilt of the rapier. Nodded in defeat, he turned and walked out with Frain in tow.  Without saying anything he walked across to Hard Journey in and up the stairs.

Pausing at the door, Tzaad whispered to himself, “Fuck this shit, I’m tired”, and walked in, closing the door behind him.
