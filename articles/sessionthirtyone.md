As the walls rumbled open ahead of them, Dom said, “Huh, well this is déjà vu. Lots of sliding rumbling walls in hell apparently…”

The room ahead was octagonal in shape, with a small altar with an inscribed rune on the crest, and the skeletons of fallen soldier scattered along the floor.

“Where are we now…?” Tzaad asked, looking in nervously.

“This appears to be the tomb…” Dara replied, “But we’ll need to travel through and find the soul stones that their souls are bound to for me to restore them.”

Dara goes in and Steph quickly nods at Waffle and moves to her side, Waffle on her other, in case of any trouble.

Surrounding them are four tunnels and armor-clad skeletons. Steph nodded and pulled out her magnifying glass again. “This served well last time!”

Steph walked around the room inspecting things, before finding claw marks and some skeletons down one of the tunnels. Looking around a little more she noticed some armor still intact on one of the skeletons. “Looks like we got some claw marks over here and some usable armor here!” Steph explained.

Tzaad walked over to the skeleton that looks to be the shape and stature of an orc and inspected the gleaming red armor. Pulling it off as gently as he could, he inspected in, and on the inside of the breastplate he found an engraving that read “Carmine, Paladin FF”, with a small engraving of a personal call sign. “Rest in peace, Carmine…” Tzaad whispered before standing up.

“Looks like this is red dragon scale mail!” Tzaad said. “Anyone need my studded leather armor?”

“Ooh, right here!” Dom called, waving his hands.

Tzaad put on the new armor and passed his existing armor over to Dom.

“Alright well we should start heading this way” Steph said, pointing towards the slaw marks and walking that way.

Everything seemed to have a faint luminescence, the absolute darkness they were dealing with before not an issue here. After about 100 feet there was another octagonal room with a pedestal and glyph. The skeletons seemed to be denser here. Steph stepped into the room, and a blinding flash of light emanated from the rune on the pedestal.

“Ahh!” Tzaad squeaked, shielded his eyes. Once the light subsided, he opened his eyes, moving his hands along his body. “I’m alright… Seems to have done nothing…”

“Looks that way”, Dom replied.

 “Did you guys know that would happen!” Steph asked.

“Well, it makes for a… Hell of a good time”, Frain replied.

“Wha…” Steph began.

“Yeah, this place really is a… Hell Hole”, Dom retorted.

“A real Hell…” Frain began before getting cut off.

“Stop it! Focus you guys, there’s danger everywhere!” Steph interjected.

Frain and Dom looked at each other and shrugged, before walking into the room.

Dara held up he bands of mourning, blood dripping onto the floor as he arms are exposed from beneath her heavy robes and closed her eyes. Turned towards one of the tunnels she pointed, “I can feel them that way.”

“Alright, let’s go” Tzaad said, happy to be moving and headed down the tunnel first.

“This is great huh guys?” Manu said suddenly.

Everyone jumped.

“Oh, whew, gonna be honest bud, forgot you were here”, Dom replied.

“Oh, come on you guys, I’ve been with you through so much of the journey, I thought we’d be cooler by now!” Manu complained. 

“Wait, haven’t you been down here before?” Frain asked.

“no, that was the other Manu!” Tzaad said, turning around and facing the rest of the group.

“I’m confused, which Manu are you again?” Dom asked, scratching his head.

“I’m the last clone! You rescued me from the Illithid  space ship and I was with you until I supposedly died at the battle of the Eastern Isles, but Sereia the mermaid saved me and nursed me back to health in her kingdom of the Coral Court. Remember!?” Manu explained. 

“Your story got a bit complicated, sorry about that Manu…” Steph apologized.

Shrugging Manu turned towards the tunnel and led the way. After a few minutes they came out to a large 60ft diameter room with rows of large stone tablets. All the tablets seemed to have a different symbol on it, call signs, most of which Tzaad recognized. The only one with a name on it was straight ahead, and it read “Lt. Mal”.

“That’s it… The lieutenant!” Tzaad said in awe. “You said you can get him out?” Tzaad asked urgently, turning towards Dara.

Dara nodded solemnly. “It will take several minutes for each soul, and it may attract unwanted attention. I can start with… Mal first though if you want.” 

“I can cast Forbiddance, but it’ll take me ten minutes to get it up” Frain said.

“I’ll cover you with my Ward of Disinterest!” Steph said excitedly, before throwing it up around the cavern’s entrance.

Frain sat down and prepared his very expensive ritual to cast Forbiddance. Once that was up, he gave a thumbs up to Dara, who turned her attention to the stone. “That should cause massive damage to any fiends crossing the threshold I’ve set up”

Closing her eyes, Dara threw up her hands, palms towards Mal’s soul stone, a gentle red light emanating from them. After a few minutes she gritted her teeth and the light intensified before a sonic boom emanated from the stone and it split in half, dust puffing up from the split rock.

Dara lowered her hands and looked over to a corner of the room where some shuffling could be heard. A figure stood up shakily, wiping off dirt from his ruined clothing and mostly intact armor. Looking around he spotted Tzaad and rubbed his eyes before walking over.

Tzaad looked into Lt. Mal’s eyes for a moment, standing at the same height, before smiling slightly. Lt. Mal broke into a wide grin and stepped forward, embracing Tzaad. Tzaad lifted his arms slowly and returned the hug.

Lt. Mal stepped back and looked past Tzaad, noticing Dara, who was looking at the ground shuffling her feet. He walked over to her slowly. The group could barely make him out, “Dara…? My little girl?”.

Dara nodded slightly, still not looking at him. Lt. Mal kneeled down and pulled her into a hug. Dara remained stiff, arms at her sides before he let go and stood up. “I understand kiddo…” Lt. Mal said gently, eyeing the wounds he spotted around her wrists, before turning to the rest of the group. 

Speaking is a light southern continent accent, he spoke up, “Alright, what have I missed and what’s the plan?”

“Well, I guess I want to know what exactly happened to you…” Tzaad replied, stepping forward. “I mean, that’s your daughter… with Zariel, and Archdevil!

“Yeah, I supposed that’s the case, ain’t it?” Mal replied, scratching the back of his head. “How longs it been then since I saw yah last, Tzaad?”

“About 12 years, give or take…” Tzaad replied.

“Yeah, I s’pose that makes sense looking at her” Mal continued, looking back at Dara. “Well, you know what happened to strand me here. We were ambushed, a scouting expedition gone wrong… I pushed you outta the portal before it closed. The only one of our company to make it out…”

“We fought hard as we could, but we got back into a corner, and for one reason or another, Zariel herself showed up, decided to show us mercy granted we join her ranks. I am not too proud to say I would rather my crew to live to see another day than die a pointless death. Faced with the power of an Archdevil we weren’t much prepared for…” Mal continued.

Dom leaned forward, apparently extremely interested now.

“Well, we joined her at the royal compound in the center of Avernus here. The days turned into weeks, then months. The… devils, they were just people once you got to know em’. Same shit as on the surface… Royals, peasants, intrigue… It just started to feel normal as the months rolled by. They treated us well surprisingly, and dang it, I came to care about a lot of em’, Zariel herself included.” Mal explained.

“But she was the enemy!’ Tzaad interjected.

“Ain’t so black and white when you break bread together. At some point I guess I just did not want to leave, Stockholm syndrome or not, one thing led to another, and I would say me and Zariel, we fell in love… I’ll spare yah the details…” Mal paused, a distant look on his face, a small smile appearing on his lips. 

“We created something so beautiful. Never thought I would live to see the day you know. Little Dara we called her, well I suppose you met her. I always considered you like a son to me Tzaad, but here was a daughter I helped create, bring into this world… It was something else.” Mal reminisced.

“Well, how did you end up here?” Dom asked.

“Ah yeah”, Mal replied. “Well that’s about the time the others began their assault. If they took Avernus, they would control the legions of hell and bring em to the surface. Well Zariel trusted me enough ta give us a mission in the Canyon of Screams, should have just been some skirmishes, but their force was overwhelming…”

“The Illithid”, Steph whispered under her breath.

Mal nodded before continuing, “Them. Well we were fighting hard, but they just kept coming. At some point a strange thing happened. It was like a second vanguard, but…” Mal looked around, biting his lower lip.

“But what? What did you see?” Dom asked pleadingly, stepping forward and putting a hand on Mal’s shoulder.

Mal looked back at him then the others. “Well, the others, them Illithid, they showed up instead of their soldiers, but they was pushing ahead of them what looked to be slaves… They were using humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes… civilians, as fodder.” Mal shook his head. “I had no choice but to order my soldiers on the defensive. We retreated but we were able to break off with the civilians and get into the tunnels. It was an epic chase…”

Mal continued, “I had our clerics setting up defenses along the way, soldiers losing their lives to give us all a chance. Eventually we made it to this tomb, sealing ourselves inside, not without a few of them getting in however… They fight like nothing else… We lost so many to just a few of them Illithid. It was like a never-ending nightmare.”

Tzaad nodded, “We know how it is, they’re tough…” 

Mal shook his head before continuing, “Well we had lost a lot of us, and we were already hungry and tired, but stuck in a tomb. So, it was starvation or bind our souls with hope of coming back one day to fight again. The clerics went to the inner sanctum with the civilians, there” Mal explained, pointing his thumb towards a large door set in the back of the cavern.

“Did you see my parents by any chance?” Dom aske, a pleading look in his eyes.

“I can’t say I’d recognize any by name, but we managed to save em all, somehow…” Mal replied. “They should be sealed and bound in the inner sanctum if they are anywhere”

“Alright, I’m going to bring up the rest now…” Dara said before getting to work immediately, not inviting comment.

Mal looked over at her with concern before looking back at the others. “As they come up, they’re gonna be in bad shape. We need some food and sleep.”

Steph nodded, “I got it! I can cast my Pillow Fort Mansion spell!”

As Steph worked on that, Mal walked around to the reviving members of the Filthy Five, speaking with them and encouraging them. Waffle followed him around, giving snoots of encouragement to each risen soldier.

Mal walked back to his soul stone and picked up a helmet from behind it before walking back to Tzaad. “I want you to have this as a small token of gratitude. Belonged to my right hand, you remember her, right Tzaad?”

Tzaad nodded, “I remember. Gidor. What happened to her?”

“She was in the final rear guard, gave her life to get us into the tomb. We only had to deal with a few of the Illithid and not all of them because of her bravery… This was her helm of telepathy.” Mal explained, handing it over and Steph taking it.

“Thanks!” Steph said, fitting it on her head.

Steph turned and waved at the portal to her mansion, “Right through here, we can bring everyone”

Mal nodded before moving around the room, the rest of the team helping, and leading the risen soldiers into the portal, twenty five in all.  Once done, Dara followed in, looking exhausted. She grabbed a large jug of water and downed it in seconds off the feast table by the entrance, before stumbling to a corner and collapsing on some pillows, asleep instantly. 

Mal walked over to her, rooting around for a comforter and pulling it over her before sitting down next to her, back against the squishy pillow wall and closing his eyes, falling asleep.

Tzaad, Dom, Frain, Steph, Manu, and Waffle found comfortable places to sleep and everyone took a long rest. With this journey also came a power up for our team to level 14!
