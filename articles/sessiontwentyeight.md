“Alright, well I have a plan to get us out of here quick. You guys ready?” Steph said suddenly, getting everyone’s attention.

After some deliberation and a bit of magic, Steph was able to cast Fly with enough slots to get everyone up and over the walls of Haven and back to the mountains they had instructed their ship to land. Everyone climbed up and in and Dom looked around at the deck, inspecting it, noticing the scorch marks and dried blood spatter. Satisfied that it was indeed their ship he headed to the control room and threw open the door.

“Hey, dwarf guy, Bjorn, bud, you in here?” Dom asked into the steamy darkness of the control room.

Walking into the light streaming from the doorway, sweaty chest heaving from the effort of being in the room apparently, Bjorn replied, “Hmm, you found me.”

“Oh great, hey, I realized I never really asked what your deal was anyways, why are you here?” Dom questioned.

“Oh, well, nobody has really asked about me in a long time… I’m touched.” Bjorn said, touching his sweaty chest, tears or sweat forming at the corner of his eyes. “Well, I’m working off a debt I owe to Queen Mab.”

“Like a slave?” Dom cut in, taken aback.

“More like indentured servitude if you will”, Bjorn replied. 

“Oh, well, are you okay?” Dom inquired.

 “Well, honestly, it’s been pretty hard. I toil day in and day out and nobody really asks how I’m doing.” Bjorn continued as tears began freely streaming down his face.

“Aw, sorry to hear that”, Dom said, walking closer and holding out his arms, “Do you need a hug?”

“I… I think that would be nice, thanks.”, Bjorn agreed, as he walked into the tender embrace of Dom’s sturdy arms. “I’ll get you guys back to Faerie in a jiff, as I assume that’s where you’re going!” Bjorn said, stepping back and clearing his throat.

“Yep that’s right! Thanks a lot for all the hard work!” Dom replied, as he turned and headed back out onto the deck with the others.

“What do we do with this ring?” Frain was asking the others as Dom approached.

Shrugging, Tzaad replied, “Let us keep it. Free wishes! Yeah!”

Everyone generally agreed just as they touched down on the mountains near Arctis Tor, a few hours south of Haven. Everyone climbed off the ship and headed over to the elevator, still waiting there in the middle of the snow and piled in. After another zig zagging journey down, they came to a stop, and the doors opened into the War Room with Queen Mab waiting for them, arms behind her back, chin up.

Here usually passive, pale face was interrupted by a small smirk at the corner of her mouth. “Welcome back, I’d like a full debriefing.”

Steph looked back at the others before filling Queen Mab in on the details of their journey since they left Faerie last. 

Nodding, Queen Mab took it all in, “Right, well it seems like we have something actionable. Before I move along with my intel, I’d like to bring someone in I think you’d like to see first.” Mab waved her hand at the entrance to the room and the door slid open, reveal Manu.

Manu walked all the way in, looking sheepish. “Hey guys, it’s me! I’m alive!”

Everyone was stunned into silence for a few moments before Dom asked tenuously, “Um, which Manu is this?”

“It’s me, I’ve been with you since the spaceship! You saved me; they say I died at the battle of the Eastern Isles!” Manu replied. “

“If you died, then how are you here…?” Tzaad asked cautiously.

“Well I didn’t die. Sagh may have seen me fall off a parapet into the ocean, but I was rescued by Sereia, the mermaid of the coral court we saved back at the clockwork carnival!” Manu explained. “I’ve been there recuperating until I was strong enough to make my way back. We couldn’t get word out since The Others control the area”.

Tzaad took a few tentative steps forward before picking Manu up in a bear hug crying out, “Manu, you son of a bitch. I thought I would never see you again!”

“Whoa! Same… back to you… buddy!” Manu wheezed unable to breath from the intensity of the hug.

Tzaad put him on the ground and everyone crowded around, clapping him on the back and expressing their joy at his return, except for Dom. Manu looked over and walked up to Dom, “Hey, I uh, know we haven’t really been close since we started traveling together… Maybe that was my fault, but I want you to know I always respected you. I’m definitely glad to see you again too…”

Dom nodded, “Uh yeah, no problem, me too. It’s my fault though, don’t worry about it!”

“So how about it, are you joining back up with our merry band?” Tzaad asked.

“Heck yeah, it that’s okay!” Manu said excitedly. 

“I’ll need someone to stay behind to run support with me”, Queen Mab cut it quickly.

The group decides to take Manu along and leave Celestial to help Queen Mab.

“Right, I’m going to go gather up my stuff then”, Manu said, backing out of the room. As the door closed, they heard him whoop in joy.

“Okay, now that reunions have been had, joy has been expressed, I will report my findings to you”, Queen Mab began. “As you know, Milo disappear from you group a while ago. I can recall my champion from anywhere at any time due to our link. I had to send her back into Avernus for an urgent mission you see… The others have taken Avernus and control the first level of Hell.”

Steph gasped, “Wow, really!?”

“Yes… really, which brings me to Milo.” Mab continued. “She was in there was in happened and was able to save another from destruction. A girl named Dara. This girl has informed us of a location in Avernus that contains the souls of the company of Hellriders that you used to be a part of, Tzaad, if I am not mistaken. She says she can restore their souls if you can get her into the tomb they are sealed within. “

“The… Filthy Five… Are you sure?” Tzaad asked, a tremble in his voice.

“Quite sure, and you can ask her yourself”, Mab replied, waving her hand at the door again as it opened and a girl that was no more than 12 years old walked in. She had on a simple black robe, with short black hair. Everyone’s eyes were drawn to her wrists, which appeared to have two thorny bracelets digging into open wounds around her wrists, blood flowing down her fingers and dripping on the floor.

 “This is Dara, daughter of Zariel”, Queen Mab said.

“Zariel, are you kidding!?” Tzaad exclaimed. “She’s a devil!”

“Calm yourself you simpleton, she is just a child, half human, half arch devil.” Queen Mab retorted. “Along with the Hellriders, your father and mother also seem to be down there, Dom”

Dom’s eyebrows raised, “Oh, well that’s a twist. That is crazy, I’ve been looking for them for so long…”
While Dom contemplated this, Tzaad asked, “Who is her father? If she is half human?”

This time Dara spoke up, her voice high pitched, “My father is named Mal.”

“What… That can’t be… He’d never sleep with the enemy!” Tzaad retorted.

“There’s a lot you don’t know, and there is a lot that’s happened. I’d rather not get too much into it, but essentially if we can get to dad… Lt. Mal and his company, I can restore them to their bodies, and they can help us fight the others… They took out my mother and they threaten all realms.” Dara explained.

Steph stepped forward, “Your arms, do you need help?”

Dara looked down at her wrists, “Ah, no thank you. These are the bands of mourning. They gift me with the Sight of hell, and the ability to restore lost souls. They are soul bound to me and with them we can restore the Hellriders… and your parents, Dom.”

Tzaad sat back onto a chair at the war table hard, holding his head with one hand, “This is… a lot. I guess we have no choice though. We have to go in.”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

“Well, how do we get there though?” Steph asked.

“Uh, well, Queen Mab, ma’am, do you guys maybe have a tuning fork attuned to Avernus? I have this spell that can get us there”, Frain asked.

“As a matter of fact, we should have a few down with the quartermaster. We’ve certainly run enough missions in there”, Mab replied. “Tell her I sent you, but before you go, I would like to bestow a gift upon you.”

Mab held up her hand and closed her eyes as a soft, chilling blue light emanated from her and engulfed everyone, granting them Boon of the Winter Queen. Everyone suddenly felt stronger, for relaxed. They had gained a whole level, bringing our adventurers all up to level 13.

Tzaad flexed and proclaimed, “Wow, thanks! This is crazy, I feel so strong”.

Queen Mab nodded and quirked the corner of her mouth up again. “Of course, it’s the least I can do. Now, tell the quarter master I sent you, and I suggest everyone else prepare what they need before you make the journey. Hell is no place to take lightly. It will push you to your limits and there is the very real prospect of death at every turn.”

 Frain headed off to the quarter master, as Tzaad and Steph discussed weaknesses of the denizens of hell and strategy.

“Do you do have a church here, your eminence?” Dom asked Mab.

Nodding, Mab replied, “Of course, we provide all employees access to the non-denominational place of worship one floor up. You are free to go there as all others”.

“I’ll be back guys, I have to prepare something”, Dom said, hurrying out of the room and towards the church.

Frain found himself one floor down, traversing a maze of corridors and office doors, looking for the quartermaster. “Where in the world…” Frain began, but stopped as he saw a nameplate flash by with ‘Quartermaster Tiana’ emblazoned across it.
 
As Frain walked in he saw a small, purple haired elf sitting behind a bare desk, jotting numbers into a ledger.

Looking up she smiled and said, “Oh, welcome, how can I help?”

“Ah, yeah, hey, I’m looking for a couple of tuning forks to Avernus, two to be exact. Queen Mab said you’d have them?” Frain replied.

“Sure do, in the armory. I can grab then for you in a jiffy. As with any requisition of course, we need to recuperate losses to replenish. That will be 500 gold!”, Tiana explained.

“But wait… Queen Mab sent me!” Frain repeated, panicked.

“Right… 400 gold when you have the favor of the queen!” Tiana clarified jovially, flipping her purple side cut and smiling.

Frain sighed audibly, “Okay, I’ll be right back…” Frain rushed out and back through the maze until he found his way back to Tzaad a Steph. “Hey uh, can I borrow 400 gold?”

“Sure!” Tzaad replied without question tossing a bag of gold at Frain.

“Thanks!” Frain replied before turning and high tailing it all the way back to Tiana’s office.

Panting, Frain held up the bag, “Okay, here you go.”

“Perfect”, Tiana said, taking the gold, jotting something down in her ledger, and handing Frain the tuning forks.

Frain took the forks and turned to go.

“Oh, by the way, if you could use the app to rate our interaction with 5 stars. I need a 4.75 average this month for a promotion, and I’m so close!” Tiana explained. 

Frain shrugged and nodded before heading out, “Sure”.

“Frain held up his watch and clicked around to Tiana and hesitated on the rating before putting in 4.5 and muttering to himself, “Good, but not a perfect experience…” Somewhere in the back of his mind, Frain felt like Tiana would remember that…

Up in the non-denominational place of worship, Dom had set up a small altar to Zeus in the corner of the room, with incense, his symbol, and a sheet of paper he had written a secret note on. After some chanting, Dom cast Word of Recall, ensuring a place to bring them back in a jam. Frain caught him in the middle of the ritual, throwing macaroni until he was finished. Dom stood up annoyed and headed back up to the war room with Frain.

After some prep, the group got together, Manu included, with Celestial hanging back. Frain set up his spell and cast Plane shift with one of the tuning forks, focusing on the Canyon of Screams as their destination.

Steph felt like she was being squeezed through a rubber tube, unable to breath. Just when she thought she might pass out, unable to take the pressure, she was out of it, sucking in grateful breaths of air, smoky and bloody as it smelled.

Immediately, a high-pitched wail seemed to fill their ears, making it hard to hear and talk. Above our group, the sky was filled with fire, as they looked up into a mass of creatures seeming to fight above the canyon. Suddenly, the charred body of something thudded to the ground next to them.

“Well this is pleasant”, Manu chimed in.

“Ew”, Steph replied simply.

Ahead of them was a network of tunnels that seemed carved into the side of the canyon. 

Yelling to be heard, Dara explained, “The bands should be able to lead us to the entrance to the tomb!”

“What?!” Tzaad yelled back.

Dara rolled her eyes and pointed at the tunnel that would lead them in the right direction. Directly ahead of the tunnel however, there were several demons patrolling. 

Tzaad nodded and threw up an OK symbol before attempting to sneak forward towards the cave. Almost immediately he tripped and fell, and the demons turned and zeroed in on him. They all flew at the group, attacking with barely restrained fury. A bone devil, two imps, and six bearded devils.

Yelling, Manu stepped into their path and opened with a flurry of blows from his staff Flo and his fists, managing to take out an imp and dealing massive damage to a bearded devil. Tzaad got back to his feet quickly and used his martial technique to take down the other imp. Steph followed up with a cone of cold, freezing a few in place.

Screaming and pointing to the sky, Dom called a lightning strike from the heavens down to hell, incinerating a few of the devils. Frain used his guiding bolt and Waffle used her Frost breath to take down all but the bone devil.

Pointing again, Dom called another lightning bolt down on the bone devil, killing it as well.

Panting, Dom smirked, “I guess lightning does strike twice.”
