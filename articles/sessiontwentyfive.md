Rob – Human Cleric – Dom Strongbottom 

Nathan – Dwarf Cleric – Frain Brightbringer

The next morning, at least he thought it was the next morning, Dom rolled out of his sleeper and into the makeshift campsite they put up the night before. Stretching and yawning he looked around, “Hey, guys, come on get up!”

Groaning and rubbing his eyes, Tzaad came out of his tent. Frain followed suit from his own tent. Celestial from her. Steph followed slowly with Waffle in tow, a vacant look in her eyes. Tzaad side eyed Steph and snapped his fingers in front of her face.

“Hey, are you alright?” Tzaad asked with concern.

Steph continued her vacant stare forward, a bit of drool in the corner of her mouth, Waffle sniffing at her shoulder with a look of worry. Tzaad shrugged and turned to the others.

“Where’s Milo?” Frain asked out loud, looking over at where her tent had been erected.

Dom walked over and shook the tent a bit before moving the flap aside. Inside he found nothing. No Milo. “Yeah, I think she’s disappeared again. Today is going to be weird.” Dom said.

Tzaad grabbed his pack, frantically opening it up and checking on the gnome he had stuffed in there. Inside he found a shallowly breathing Stellar, with purple extremities and a pale look about him.

“Oh crap…” Tzaad muttered, pulling him out quickly and untying him as well as pulling out the gag. The skin where the binding was around his wrist were red and raw.

Dom walked up, using a medicine check to figure out he’s in a bad condition.

“Allow me”, Frain declared, swaggering up and moving them out of the way.

Frain cracked his knuckles and cast cure wounds. Tzaad remembered he had healing potions and tipped one into Stellar’s mouth as well. This brought him around, Stellar’s eyes fluttering open.

Sputtering and coughing, Stellar’s eyes widened, “Y… You guys! Where am I? What the hell is going on!?”

“Hang on there buddy, I’m sorry for how we’ve treated you and I hope we can move past that”, Tzaad explained.

“Yeah, we’re kind of stuck in another realm here and there’s nowhere to go, so you can just join us or make your own way”, Dom chimed in.

“Oh, what a choice. Brave an unknown world by my self or join my captors willingly!” Stellar retorted.

“I understand it’s not ideal, but it’s what we got. Sorry again”, Tzaad reiterated before standing back up.

I think we should go talk to that Murder woman!” Frain declared.

Everyone shrugged and agreed, and after some stubbornness from Stellar, he followed behind. They headed around the back of Town Hall and into the Town Square. In what they presumed to be the morning; the Town Square was lively with activity. In front of town hall was a tall woman behind a desk scribing something. There were a few more stalls around the center fountain with some older women gathered around them, chatting. 

Frain looked around and walked over to the woman in front of town hall, “Hail and well met!”

The woman looked up from the scrolls she was writing on, eyes narrowing, set in a thin, high cheekbone face, with the word ‘PRIDE’ tattooed across her dark forehead. “I haven’t seen you before, what pray, is your business here?”

“Why would you say that?” Dom asked, a blank look on his face.

“The town isn’t very large, and I pride myself on meticulous cataloguing and perfect recollection…” Pride replied haughtily.

“Yeah I can see that”, Frain said nodding. “Alright, we need to find the center of the library, we’re looking for something”

Pride’s eyebrows nearly disappeared into her locks, “The heart you mean…? Why would you think I have any information that could help you?”

“Well you’re writing a bunch of stuff down…” Frain replied, uncertain.

Pride rolled her eyes and pointed to the women around the fountain, “If you want information like that, talk to the Elders, and leave me alone.”

The group nodded in thanks a walked over to the group of people in the center. Approaching them they saw for older women gathering, all with their white hair all in similar fashion to each other gathered in braids and a tight ponytail at the top of their heads. Across each of their foreheads were words, presumably denoting their names. They were ‘Magnanimity’, ‘Gold’, ‘Fur’, and ‘Grass’”.

“Hail and well met”, Frain called with his hand raised towards the elders.

Magnanimity turned, a look of surprise on her face. “Welcome visitors, what do you need?”

“Alright I’ll cut right to it, we’re looking for the Heart of the library”, Dom replied.

Magnanimity looked around at the others, faces lit up with surprise then delight. Barely suppressing a chuckle, she replied, “The Heart you say? Heh, okay, tell you what, I will let you know what I know if you can find my daughter. Her name is Saline, and she does this sometimes, disappearing for a day or two, but today is important and I need her here now.”

Shrugging, Frain looked around and spotted Glue running by, “Excuse me for a second.”

Hurrying over to Glue, Frain stopped him and pull him to another part of the Town Square. “Hey kid, we’re looking for Saline, do you know where she is?”

Glue’s joyful face when blank suddenly, a careful look on his face. “No?”

“It’s okay, we’re her friend we just want to talk to her”, Frain continued.

“I’m not supposed to, she told me not to!”, Glue replied.

“Look, how about a trade, I’ll give you…”, Frain kicked a rock up stealthily and cast light on it, before pulling out from behind his back and showing Glue, “…this shiny rock!”

Glue inspected the rock, a hungry look on his face. “Okay! But you have to promise not to tell anyone!”

“Cross my heart”, Frain agreed, smiling.

Glue looked around and hurried around the back of the building. Frain looked over to the others and beckoned them over, filling them in quickly before they followed. Glue ran through the back streets until they got to the alley where they saw Murder the night before.

“Okay, it’s down here” Glue said, leading them to a door in the alley at the back set into a large square building of bookcases.

Tzaad stepped forward, rapping on the door quickly. After a few moments, the door creaked open and an annoyed looking woman with a few scars on her face and brown bushy hair peering out at them. Across her forehead was the word “Murder”. 

Tzaad took a step back, “Oh, sorry, we’re looking for Saline?”

Murder looking around at them, then down at Glue with a scowl. “Did this little brat lead you here? What did I say Glue?”

“I’m sorry, they gave me a shiny rock!”, Glue replied, cowering before Murder’s stare before running off.

Murder scoffed and hesitated a moment, then stepped back opening the door wider. “Get in here quick, don’t want anyone else seeing”

Everyone piled into the doorway, down a hallway and into a small studio. On a couch against the wall was another woman with black hair, freckled, and the word ‘Saline’ tattooed across her forehead.

“Who are these people?” Saline demanded, jumping up.

“Glue led them here, they’re looking for you…” Murder replied. 

“Oh, what do you want?” Saline asked.

Tzaad stepped forward, “Well… Magnu… Maganama… Banana…”

“Magnanimity?” Saline interjected.

“Yeah!” Tzaad said nodding. “They wanted us to find you for information on the Heart.

Murder and Saline looked at each other then back at the group. Looking excited, Saline began, “You guys are adventurers, right? You’re not from around here, you have to be from out there!”

Tzaad shrugged, “I guess so”.

Excitement mounting, Saline continued, “Murder has been near the Heart! I’ve never been out of the town, but we can help you, if you help us!”

“I don’t know…”, Dom spoke up, looking uncomfortable, “What do you need?”

“Take us with you! Hear me out, we hate this place. They labeled my partner here Murder because her father killed her mother when she was only a few months old! She’s been ostracized ever since, but she’s the best person I know!” Saline finished, looking over at Murder with admiration in her eyes.

Murder crossed her arms, sighing, “I guess it would be nice to get out of here, we’ve just never had anywhere to go. But if we could get out of this realm…”

The group conferred and agreed they would take them.

“Yay!” Saline squealed, running over to Murder and pulling her into a hug, pecking her on the cheek quickly before running around with a bag gathering essentials. “Let’s get out of here as soon as possible, we’ve got nothing left to do anyways!”

While Saline did this, Tzaad turned to Murder, “Why do you go by Murder, you could call yourself anything!”

“I’m not ashamed of who I am, even if it is someone else who decided that fate for me…” Murder replied stoically.

A short while later, they all headed out and were able to escape the small town without much hassle. Murder led the way and turned left at the fork in front of the entrance, a little past the elevator the group arrived in. After about an hour walk the bookshelves began to give way to a forest of sorts, but the trees were made of leather and paper, the dirt the same just ground up.

“We’re entering the Forest of Books, watch your step… I have a Page Knight who’s a friend here”, Murder explained to the others. 

Murder stopped after a few minutes in the forest and leaned up against a tree.

“What are we doing?” Dom asked, confused.

“Waiting, he’ll find us.” Murder replied. 
 After a few minutes Frain asked, “So where are we exactly? I know we’re somewhere else since we got through a portal of sorts through the Scholar’s Spire.”

Murder looked up, “The Spire? Interesting, so you’re from the material plane?”

“Yeah, where else would we be from?” Frain replied.

Murder shrugged, “This is on the edges of the ethereal plane.”

“Whoa…” Dom said.

Just then Tzaad felt a presence behind him… sniffing his ear? He turned around quickly taking a few steps back and looking directly into the belly button of what looked to be a centaur. Looking up to his face, it was an Orc centaur, with two gold ring nipple piercings in gently bouncing pectorals, and a scowling face.

“Intruders… What business have you here…” the orc boomed.

“It’s me, calm down” Murder said, removing herself from the tree.

The orc centaur backed up a bit from where he was leaning into Tzaad menacingly, his eyes brightening and a smile appearing. “My dear friend, of course! Forgive me, my name is Giggle, the guardian of this forest”

Nobody moved an inch when they heard his name. “Nice to meet you… Giggle.” Tzaad replied cautiously.

Giggle nodded and looked around, “What are you doing here?”

“Well, we’re looking for the heart”, Frain replied.

Giggle raised his eyebrows, “The Heart is not for the weak. It is not even a place I step foot, for I am too pure a creature to near such a den of pure evil. Are you certain this is what you wish?”

In unison, everyone agreed, “Absolutely!”

“Very well then, an evil force controls the heart however and I will request your weaker member stay here with me until you are about to clear it out. They would most certainly perish amidst the enemies.” Giggle said, looking around at Stellar, Murder, and Saline. 

After agreeing to this, Giggle began the trek leading the way about 45 minutes further into the forest. As they slowed, Tzaad felt the cold touch of dread on his heart and rolled a wisdom save, failing and becoming extremely sad for 10 minutes.

“What’s wrong over there, bud, you look a little down…” Dom asked, looking over at Tzaad.

“I don’t know…” Tzaad sniffled.

“He will be feeling the effects of the monstrosity inhabiting the heart. This is as far as I go, it is not much further ahead. Good luck.” Giggle explained. 

As they continued and neared the Heart, the trees became barren and there was a ring of darkness it seemed, everything was more out of focus and harder to see. It seemed suddenly that the surround area was bookshelf and book again. Tzaad neared one of the books, noticing they were all bleeding and appeared to be bound in fresh flesh. He shuddered and backed away.

Sense immense evil further along, Frain stopped and spoke up, “I have an idea, I can call upon a god servant with a sacrifice and gain some information!”

They agreed this was a good idea and Frain set about. He pulled out an old crossbow he was no longer using, along with some reagent and set up his ritual. He burned the crossbow and chanted, a ringing of power filling his ears until he felt a presence. “Okay, uh… What is the being that causes this dread?”

After a moment he felt a reply from some lesser entity… 

Click Clack…
Part God Part Dead…
Keep Your Wits…
To Ace the Rack…
