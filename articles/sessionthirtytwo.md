Dom contemplated the glistening black door ahead of him, surrounding by the split soul stones, cracked open the night before by the young Dara. He blinked and seemed to look through the door. He saw his parents just on the other side… They were within reach at last. Dom reached into his pocket, absentmindedly twirling the stone he kept in there between his fingers. Bea… Could she be in there too? He shook his head, “No…” he whispered out loud. “She left me all on her own…”

Frain’s eyes shot open and he sat up in the pillow bed, looking around frantically, his body singing the pillows beneath him. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, steadying himself, and allowed himself to cool off. Sighing and shaking his head, he hopped out of bed and onto the floor with a thump and got dressed in his usual robes. After praying to Kossuth, he gathered his trinkets and weapons and headed out in the corridor.

Dara heard a knock at her door. She was sitting in the corner of the room at a wash basin, soaking her torn and tattered wrists in warm water, eyes distant and unseeing. The door creaked open and Frain peeked his head in.

“Uh, hey… Dara, right?” Frain asked, sliding in as best as a dwarf could, though it was more of a lumbering shuffle.

Dara’s eyes regained focus and she looked around, then looked back into the wash basin, rolling her eyes. “If you have to ask, you’re in the wrong room.”

Frain shrugged and hopped up on the bed, facing Dara. “So, uh, how are you holding up? First time you have seen your dad, right? And you must’ve been exhausted after all you did yesterday.” Frain strained a bit, intoning an empathetic tone like he was taught, to put others at ease.

Dara stared into the basin for a moment before responding, “Yeah… I uh, I do not know what I expected honestly… He seems nice, and mother always talked about him like he was some hero… I just…” she trailed off, staring into the rippling water, pink with her blood.

 Frain sat quietly, listening.

Steph tossed and turned violently before sitting up, rubbing her eyes. She looked over and saw the massive, heaving form of a sleeping Waffle. Steph stretched and yawned, spending the next 30 seconds climbing and slipping out of the massive mound of pillows she could not help but hoard last night. Waffle hopped out of the pile gracefully and followed Steph to the breakfast buffet.  

Tzaad tossed and turned, mumbling to himself before startling awake. “Ah, huh, wha…?” Tzaad looked around but was only able to move his head. He realized he was neck deep in a pillow hole. It all came rushing back to him, the nightmare of pillows, he had only really slept of flat, hard surfaces most of his life. He remembered trying to get comfortable, adjusting and flinging pillows, eventually pummeling them, and tossing them away at an alarming rate, trying to find a flat surface. Eventually he exhausted himself, finding no end to the pillows and falling asleep in the avalanche that encompassed him.  

Frain and Dara passed by Tzaad, Dara seeming to ignore him completely, and Frain did a double take, looking down at Tzaad. “Whoa, Where’s the rest of your body?”

“Where’s the rest of my… Are you kidding me, I am stuck neck deep in pillows here! Help me out!” Tzaad cried, flailing his hardest but sinking deeper into quick pillows.

Manu appeared around the corner and started hurrying towards Tzaad, “Don’t worry Tzaad, I’ve got…”

Frain chuckled and reached in before Manu could get there, finding one of Tzaad’s arms and hauling his out. Tzaad collapsed in a heap on the ground and lay there, panting, before scrambling up and sniffing the air. “Is that… bacon and… eggs?” He ran off towards the smell, sliding on pillows every now and again and running into a wall or two before disappearing.

Manu deflated after the interaction and followed with shoulders drooped.

Dara blinked and shook her head, following in the same direction, Frain close behind.

Tzaad grabbed a waffle, and slathered peanut butter on it before flipping it closed like a taco and munching on it. Frain shuddered as he walked into the banquet hall, witnessing this.

Dara walked past the feast and out of the portal of the mansion and back into the tomb. She walked out as Dom was whispering to himself. “Who’s… Bea?” Dara asked, curiously.

Dom looked back as Dara stepped out. “Oh, she is… Just history…” Dom replied, staring past Dara sadly. Looking down at Dara’s arms, Dom’s eyebrows furrowed, “Are you sure you don’t need more healing? I have a few spells.”

Dara shook her head, “No, it’s okay, I cope and heal quickly, I’m no human after all.”

Steph and Waffle walked out of the portal behind Dara and put her hand on Dara’s shoulder, “Hey, thanks for everything you’ve done so far. I just want to let you know we will keep you safe no matter what, and we will beat the others and get your mother back. Don’t worry!”

Dara gave a half-hearted smile and shrugged away from Steph’s hand. Steph let her hand hover for a moment before dropping by her side again.

Tzaad, Manu, Frain, and Lt. Mal Rey walked out of the portal shortly. The others gathered up and conversed while Mal walked over to Dara and kneeled to her height. “Hey kiddo… I…” 

Dara looked up slightly into his eyes, a bit of hope and uncertainty, and a lot of sadness filling her eyes.

Mal stopped short, staring into Dara’s eyes, his own eyes tearing up a little before he wiped them away. “I just wanted ta say, I, well, I hope you know I love you, and when you’re ready, I’ll be here.” Mal reached into his coat pocket and pulled out two bangles, handing them over to Dara. The Bands of Faithfulness, it will get you into the inner sanctum.

Dara nodded and slipped them on, as Mal stood up and turned towards the others. “Keep her safe now, ya hear?”

Tzaad stood at attention and saluted, almost by reflex, “Sir!”

Dara walked past everyone and towards the obsidian doors, toward two small holes at the base. She looked back at the others briefly before shoving her arms in until a rumbling announced the opening, and she took a few steps back. 

Tzaad quickly moved into formation in front of her, pulling up Hard Pass in this left arm, and unsheathing his moon blade, using it as a light source, and walked in, leading the pack.

Through the doorway was a pitch-black hallway, dimly illuminated by Tzaad’s sword, about 10 feet wide and 10 feet tall made of the same hewn black stone as the doorway. After a few steps in everyone noticed the distant sounds of soft, elven music. Ahead there was a break in the tunnel, leading into a small foyer with another door on the other side of the small room.

Tzaad stepped in carefully, before looking over his should and throwing a thumbs up. Almost immediately after however there was the sound of a deafeningly loud gong, following by 14 more all in succession. 

Dom removed his hands from his eyes and looked around at everyone. “You think anyone heard that?”

Frain chuckled and stepped up to the door, twisting the knob and opening it. Beyond the was a large chamber, cloaked in darkness. Frain cast Daylight at the center of the room, illuminating a tiled chamber about 100 feet long and 50 feet wide. They were at the East wall. Along the north and south walls were black stone doors as well.

“Alright, I’m the most observant so I’ll go in first, wait here.” Steph explained before stepping into the room. She inches along the east wall to the right, until she got to the corner and started along the north wall until she stopped suddenly. Looking down on the very next tile from her she noticed a faintly glowing symbol.

“Hey Dara, come here and tell me if you recognize this symbol!” Steph called out.

Dara hurried over to her, but on the very next tile to her Dara seemed to trigger something, sending tendril of necrosis on her legs. Dara screaming and fell, seemingly hit with lethal damage. Steph cried out and grabbed Dara as she fell, pulling her close.

“Oh no, Dara I’m so sorry! Dom, get over her quick, we need to heal her!” Steph cried out.

Dom quickly cast detect magic and weaved his way diagonally towards Steph, avoid symbols on he tiles as he encountered them, and marking them as he passed for the others. Dom made it over and stabilized Dara.

“Guys, follow the trail I marked!” Dom called to Manu, Tzaad, and Frain.

They followed the trail until they made it to Dom and Steph. There was suddenly a loud crack, and a flash of light and all the symbols seemed to fizzle and hiss out of the stone.  A chain demon appeared out of nowhere in a whipped Steph across the back, the most exposed member, before disappearing in a puff of smoke again.

Steph screamed, shielding Dara, and taking 33 damage herself. Tzaad launched into action, using bait and switch on Steph to move here into safety. Manu pulled out Flo and used a whirlwind of blows to take out several imps that had appeared. Waffle hovered near Dara and Steph, protecting them. Dom and Frain cast a few spells, managing to injure the demon.

Cackling, the chain demon screamed out, “Hahaha, Sareash knows no bounds, you’ll never find me with normal rounds!” With that, Sareash disappeared in a puff of smoke again, along with the surviving imps. 

Frain took over healing Dara until she opened her eyes weakly, shaking her head. “What happened?”

“It’s alright, you ran into a trap” Steph said.

“Man, I feel like we are way unprepared for Hell, and we’ve been down here a while” Tzaad proclaimed, scratching the back of his head, and looking around.

Frain shrugged and pointed at the door next to them. “Well we are near this door, so you know what we do with doors…”

“Admire them?” Dom asked.

“Investigate them!” Steph said.

“Attack them.” Tzaad replied matter of factly.

“Open them…” Frain said, exasperated, and opened the door.

Through the northern doorway was another hallway, this one sloping downward for about 20 feet before turning sharply. Following the hallway to the turn, it opened into a 90-foot run, 30 feet wide with 3 rows of pillars, reaching 60 feet up to the ceiling. Looking closer at the pillars Dom made out intricate carvings that looked like battles between the filthy five and the Illithid. 

Tzaad began to move forward but Steph stopped him and pointed up at the luminescence near the ceiling. Peering closer, Tzaad saw it was 8 flame skulls hovering around.

“Oh, I see” Tzaad whispered, nodding. “Sneaky time…” Tzaad made unintelligible motions with his hands and arms before putting his arms up and beginning to tiptoe forward.

As Tzaad put his first toe down, he rolled a stealth check… and failed. All 8 flame skulls swiveled towards him at once and careened downward at the group, locking them in battle.

Waffle had darted back into the previous hallways with Dara, peering around and keeping her shielded from harm. Steph nodded and turned towards the flame skulls. She cast a magic missile to spread out some damage, feeling them out.

Sareash appeared again with a cackle and got a direct lash across Dom’s back, crippling him and dealing poison damage. Dom yelled and went down on one knee, held down by the chains on him.

Manu took down the last imp and sought out Sareash, attacking him furiously. Frain turned his attention to Sareash as well, hitting him with Harm.

Tzaad was able to take out a flame skull, and Dom another. Steph used this to her advantage, casting catapult on one of the skulls at Sareash. The skull slammed into Sareash, replacing his head with the skull. Sareash’s bod wobbled cartoonishly for a moment before falling to the ground in a heap. 

One of the flame skulls cast a fireball.

“Whoa, that took a chunk of our health!” Tzaad yelled.

Another fireball came down. And another, and another, and another, until the remaining six had all cast fireball, devastating the party. Dom had gone down and was on his last death rolling save, Steph had just gone down. The rest were barely holding on.

Frain cast a mass cure wounds, managing to stabilize and heal everyone to a small amount of health.

Tzaad roared and brandished his sword, jumping at the nearest pillar, and leaping upward, getting within range of the cluster of fire skulls. In a flurry of blows Tzaad took down 4 of the remaining fire skulls. Steph took out the remaining two.

As the final fire skull fell to the ground, extinguished, everyone collapsed down where they stood, gasping to catch their breath.

Dom clutched his foot, “Ah shoot guys, I think I’, really hurt…” Looking down he saw two of his toes missing on his left foot, and his leg was broken. He took a permanent 5-foot speed loss.

Steph held her left hand up to her face, examining the spot where her pinky finger should have been, losing a permanent 1 dexterity. 

Steph teared up with a grimace on her face, “That was my favorite pinky…”
