Celestial, walking up behind Tzaad, who was on his knees in front of the grave yelling to the heavens, played a sad melody from her lute, vocalizing a sad tune, and inadvertently creating a new theme song for the campaign!

Looking skeptical, Steph chimed in, “Are we sure it is Manu?”

Stopping mid wail, Tzaad replied, “Uh, I think so”.

At this point, he decided to start digging. As Tzaad begins there was a sudden rustling form the nearby trees and bushes. Within seconds the group was surrounded by 3 large animated trees, looking very angry with no faces. Falling into formation, or murder hobo adventurers knew just what to do… Set everything on fire. Tzaad popped off a shot with his anti-matter rifle at one, and dropped it to the ground afterwards, seeming to be out of ammo, and pulling out his sword and shield. Frain used burning hands to set two on the right on fire, and Steph followed up with a Bonfire spell, setting the last on fire. Dom tried to gently touch a burning bush but hurt himself instead. With a frost breath turning frost fire from Waffle, the trees tried to run, but the group wasn’t finished. They finished two off, but one made it to the tree line, setting the forest on fire!

Panicking, Tzaad decided to run back to Oakshadow with Steph to warn him. They made it to the singing apple grove and warned him of the coming fire storm. Oakshadow, weary with age and sadness, gathered up the remaining apples and disappeared into the bush. Meanwhile, Frain was actually able to counter burn the fire with a well placed and rolled burning hands, cutting off the fuel supply of the moving fire. When Tzaad and Steph returned to the area, they found the fire stopped.

Tzaad decided what the hell and finished digging up the body. Inside the grave he found a fully decomposed body, missing its head. Unable to make much out or find anything of worth on the body, they continued to the final bend. About 25 feet above them was the other platform they saw from across the ship. They all climbed the ladder, levitating Waffle to get her up. 

On the platform they saw set into the wall four shafts, with crashed elevators at the bottom. To the left of them was a smaller hatch, a service hatch. Tzaad was able to force it open and inside was a ladder leading up another 50 feet. Climbing in, everyone followed the ladder up to another hatch, leading into a small, sterile white room, with door that looked like elevator doors in the wall to the shafts. Waffle again towed behind on a levitation spell.

A little ragged at this point from all the activity on the previous level, the group decided to take a short rest here. Lifting their spirits, Celestial picked at her lute, singing and rapping soft and healing tunes. After healing up and gaining some spells back our adventurers decided to move on. Tzaad went first, stepping up to the door on the wall opposite the shafts. As he approached and got within a few feet, there was a soft hiss as the door moved back an inch, and slid to the side, opening for them automatically. 

Inside, the room was rectangular with 4 rows of chairs in the middle, and what seemed like shifting, abstract art on the walls. To the left, right, and straight ahead were doors, leading to various rooms. Steph walked up to one f the art pieces, staring into it’s depths in wonder at the shifting shapes and colors. 

Looking around, Tzaad spotted a small metal box swiveling around, with a glass lens on the front. Approaching it cautiously, he suddenly swung out at it with his sword, and severed some cables behind it, seeming to disable it. Unfortunately, as he severed the cords, a small puff of purple smoke shot out and into Tzaad’s face before he could react. Failing a constitution save in a spectacular fashion he looked down to find his index finger slowly fall off his hand and to the floor.

“Uh, guys, what the hell, what…”, Tzaad started saying before he noticed his middle finger fall off his hand as well.

Tzaad’s appendages all began to melt away and he began to freak out, yelling out to the group. Looking over at him, Steph saw nothing wrong, and tried to calm him down. From Tzaad’s perspective, it looked as though everyone else was screaming at his affliction. Soon Tzaad’s hands fell off, then his arm as he reached for it, and after that his other arm. Backing away his leg fell off and he stumbled backwards into a corner. His nose, mouth, and eyes went next, and he began to suffocate. Stepping over his body, Frain headed into the next room to the left, a soft hiss as the door slid to the side. Shortly after he stepped in, Tzaad’s symptoms suddenly subsided before he suffocated. Gasping for breath, Tzaad was able to see and noticed all his limbs were back in place!

Inside the room, Frain saw a square room with every wall lined with thousands of small glass drawers, each with a small glass cube filled with liquid constantly changing colors. Each drawer was labeled with a weird alien script. As Frain reached out to one of the drawers, it opened automatically with an audible hiss. Pulling out a cube, Frain examined it closely, and found a small square button on one side, but nothing more. 

Shrugging, Frain pressed the button, and a puff of colored smoke shot into his face suddenly. After a moment, Frain found that he felt really good, and felt like he was resistant to radiant damage for 4 hours. Steph stepped into the room, looking around in wonder.

“Wow, what does it all say?”, Frain asked her. 

“I don’t know, but I can find out!”, Steph replied. 

Going back into the other room, Steph sat cross legged on the floor, and pulling out a little salt and some herbs, she performed a ritual cast of her comprehend languages spell. After fifteen minutes she had it and headed back into the drawer room. Looking closely at one of the labels on the drawer, Steph stepped back and rubbed her eyes, and then looked again. Labeled on each of the drawers were named such as “Methionylthreonylglutamineylarginyl”.  Steph could hardly even say it, and everyone scratched their heads in confusion at the words.

Tzaad was tired of waiting and grabbed another cube excitedly and used it on himself. Chest puffing out, he felt strong, and found he had his strength increase to 21 for 4 hours. Getting excited now, Tzaad started grabbing cubes and shoving them into his pack. After about the fifth however, they bumped into each other and started going off in his face. One after the other, they puff into his face, and incurred various effects on him. He suddenly felt good again, gaining 13 extra temporary hit points. A few more in however, he suddenly became very afraid. The final puff of smoke rendered him blind. Tzaad started panicking at this point and flailing around, picking up and throwing more cubes around.

Frain got blasted by one, turning his skin a weird greenish purple for several hours. After a few moments, Dom was able to calm Tzaad down, restraining him and moving him back to the chair room. While they waited and recovered a bit in the chair room, and waited for Tzaad to become less frightened, Steph hooked up a harness to Waffle as a guide dog for Tzaad for the time being. Once Tzaad calmed down, but was still blind, they decided to go to the room to the left now. 

Stepping up to the door, it hissed and slid sideways for Steph. Walking in and looking around, Steph gasped out loud as she took in what she was seeing. Directly in front of her on a table was a dark-skinned human body, with no head. In a glass display case on the far wall was a dissected human male, all the organs and parts labeled in the same strange alien script. To the left, on a small table were monk’s clothing and a familiar looking staff. On the right wall was another small table, but with 5 small glass cases, each with a blue viscous liquid in it. In three of the cases were humanoid heads, a hand in the fourth, and a brain in the fifth. 

Walking up to the cases, Steph looked closely at one and stumbled back in terror. Inside the glass case was the head of Manu the Monk. As everyone yelled and freaked out, Tzaad was confused.

“What? What is going on, what do you guys see!?”, Tzaad cried out.

“It’s Manu!”, Steph replied.

After everyone had calmed down, Dom stepped forward and took his head out of the jar. Manu’s head immediately began to gasp and go limp. Dom put the head back in the jar quickly. Steph decided to try and communicate. 

“Blink once for yes, twice for no”, Steph explained, before beginning to ask questions.

After each question, Manu seemed to think for a moment and blink once. However, after starting to ask nonsensical questions, they realized he was just blinking every few seconds and not answering them. 

“Here, hand him to me and we’ll take him with us for now”, Tzaad said.

“Hand him to you?”, Celestial asked gleefully.

Reaching forward and pulling out the hand from one of the jars, she put it into Tzaad’s outstretched hand. Yelling out in disgust, Tzaad tried to throw whatever he was handed to the ground. However the hand suddenly clasped onto his wrist. Yelling and shaking his arm frantically, Tzaad tried to pry the fingers off. Waffle saw the commotion, and tried to snap at the hand, but Tzaad had successfully pried it off already, and Waffle bit Tzaad in the hand. Screaming out in pain, Tzaad threw the hand to the ground, where it twitched and went still. Waffle, looking abashed, slinked over to the hand and picked it up, carrying it around in her mouth.  

Wanting to get out of there, the group headed back to the chair room, and decided to head through the forward door now. Frain stepped up to the door and it hissed open. Stepping in he saw several things. Straight ahead was an empty operating table, with a medical version of the robot they had encountered earlier. Lining every wall were what seemed like screens showing moving pictures and diagrams. Along one of the walls were 3 of the normal robots with rifles, at attention. 

The medical bot swiveled towards him suddenly and cried out, “Remain still while I administer your medicine!”

Surprised, Frain was pushed up against the wall and got a puff of colored smoke in his face before he could react. He coughed for a moment but other felt fine after a good constitution saving throw. Up on the screens, what seemed like diagrams of Frain and labels of his body parts, scrolling through x-ray, infrared and other forms of analysis on his body popped up on the walled. 

The medical bot turned to Steph and repeated her messaged, rushing at Steph. Steph reacted, puffing a spray of poison at it. It was combat time now! The med bot in the other room, everyone is focusing on it, with Frain left alone with the rifle bots. Frain blasted off a fireball on the bots, doing some resisted damage. The guard bots all laid into Frain with their laser rifles in a firing line, but he was resistant to radiant damage still! 

Tzaad had Waffle lead him to the med bot and attempted to swing at it with his sword. Unfortunately, a critical failure occurred, and he missed so badly, he chopped into his own arm holding onto the harness on Waffle, doing doubled damage as it is Moon touched and he was a shape shifter! Crying, Tzaad put away his sword quickly with a trembling hand. Waffle broke away from Tzaad after that, and let out a frost breath that decimated the three guard bots, as Steph finished off the med bot. 

Taking a moment to catch their breath, Dom noticed another door along the left wall. Walking up to it, it did not open automatically like the other. Next to the door was a small square with 5 indents in it. Frain walked up and put his hand on it. It beeped for a few seconds but then flashed red with a quick noise of rejection. Steph ran back to where Waffle dropped the hand and picked it up, and ran back, handing the hand to Frain. Frain put the hand on the metal square. After a few seconds of beeping, the square flashed green with a ding and the door slid open.

Through the doorway they were presented with a narrow hallway leading to another door at the end. Before heading into certainly more trouble, our adventurers decided to rest in the room first, recuperating their strength for the final leg of their struggle through this blasted ship.
