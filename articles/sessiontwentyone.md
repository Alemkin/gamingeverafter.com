Steph groaned and rubbed her eyes, opening them to a stream of sunlight from leaves above piercing into her eyes. Rolling over she saw Waffle standing and shaking, and the rest of the crew, including Tzaad, Frain, and Dom just stirring. 

Suddenly, two figures came crashing through the trees, and Steph thought she recognized them… Tzaad pulled out Hard Pass and his sword and brought them to the ready, eyes still closed.

“Why how the hell are ya, you wankers”, Jim belted out in his familiar cockney accent.

Jim, breathing heavily, leaned over Tzaad and slapped him a bit, “Oy, wake up will yah?”

Tzaad cracked open his left eye, then his right, and recognized Jim, with Abel standing over him as well.

Dom rolled over onto his side and stood up, “So what are you guys doing here, did you just wake up here too, or…?”

“Yeah, we just woke up here, not sure what’s goin’ on… Oh that reminds me, we were being chased by…” Jim began, but was cut off by a snarling from the tree line, and a number of wild dog looking creatures began appearing, yelp and growls accompanied by a show of teeth. They recognize them as Jackals.


Suddenly the group found themselves surrounded on all sides by a seemingly endless torrent of jackals. Tzaad rolled and jumped up, swinging, but missed! These Jackals were strange somehow, and it became apparent when, after Jim ran away like a bitch, they used hypnotic gaze in tandem on Tzaad, knocking him out cold, and target Dom as well.

Abel was able to rouse them back after large waves of attacks. Dom used his faithful shatter to take out droves. Steph used fireball to incinerate a number. Frain came in with a channel divinity. Tzaad chopped left and right. Unfortunately, as they killed them, they noticed them morphing into humans. These were were-jackals, and Tzaad was chopping off butts indiscriminately! 

As they killed a good number of them, everyone heard a voice from seemingly all around them, “Interesting…”

They neared the end of the waves when on a new round, those they had killed before began rising from the dead, newly reanimated! 

“Oh crap, watch out, they’re moving!” yelled Frain.

Tzaad continued severing butts left and right, missing the undead with already missing butts. They had eliminated most of them again when a wave of nausea ran through everyone, forcing constitution saving throws. Everyone failed and froze in place. 

From their left came a crashing of trees as they thudded to the ground, shoved over by something monstrous in size. A few moments later, unable to move their bodies, they strained their eyes and saw a larger than life Illithid floating through the trees and out onto the path.

It floated up to each of our adventurers, peering into their eyes, it’s horrible tentacles lashing out, touching their features. It stopped at Tzaad, “Foolish mortals, once enthralled and now free, beware, you know not what you trifle with. Interfere again and face a wrath yet unknown to your puny, irrelevant lives.”

With that, Tzaad was tossed back, slamming into a tree and thudding to the ground. The Illithid turned it’s attention on Steph and began to float towards her, when out of nowhere came a war cry and a leaping figure. It was Jim, jumping onto it’s back and stabbing with a small dagger!

“Go, get out of here!” Jim screamed, slashing and stabbing frantically. 

Steph woke up suddenly, on her back again, but this time in a familiar bed. She opened her eyes and looked around and saw her sister, Annie, sleeping nearby. She was back in the tower at the Winter Queen’s castle. 

“Psst, sis, hey, sis”, Steph began, trying to rouse Annie.

Annie grumbled and rolled over, “No, I don’t want any pie…”

Shrugging, Steph patted Annie’s head and headed out onto the staircase outside her quarters. 

Tzaad woke up, yelling and slashing at the air with nothing but his fist. He looked around wildly and saw Manu lying next to him, and sighed in relief, “Oh thanks She, I’m back”

When Tzaad spoke, Manus eyes flew open and he looked around in panic, crying out and clutching at Tzaad.

“Shh, be quiet, it’s okay”, Tzaad soothed, holding Manu 2 by the shoulders until he calmed. “I’ll be right back, just stay here”, Tzaad said and got up to go find the others.

Tzaad found Steph and Frain in the hallway, heading to get Dom. They all headed there and woke him and discussed the dream they seemed to share.

“I have something I need to do before we continue”, Steph said, and headed back to her room to talk with Annie.

“hey sis, sorry I was a bit groggy earlier”, Annie said as Steph entered the room.

“That’s okay sis, I actually wanted to talk to you about what I’m doing next. Hear me out before you say anything. I need to go now, we have a mission to stop what’s going on here. We have to save the world… Or something…”, Steph finished meekly before straightening her back and looking her sister in the eye defiantly.

Annie looked stern them her eyes softened and she nodded, “You’re strong sis, you’ve grown a lot since I last saw you… Friends, purpose, power. You’re amazing”, Annie said in awe.

Steph smiled and stepped forward, embracing Annie. After a few moments they pulled apart and looked each other in the eyes. Steph nodded and turned, walking out. She met the others outside Manu’s room and headed in together.

Tzaad looked at the others then leaned over Manu 2 and shook him gently on the shoulder. Manu woke wild eyed again and needed some calming with words from Tzaad and Frain stroking his hair. Manu coughed, “I think I need some water”.

Frain ran over to the mini bar and opened it up. “What do these number mean? Is that how much it costs?!” Frain exclaimed, seeing 4.95 gold next to a small bottle of water. He looked back at Manu then back at the water, before picking it up with a trembling hand and bringing it back. “It’s fine, I’m sure they’ll understand”, Frain said, looking around nervously and checking his empty pockets.

Manu gulped the water down gratefully and coughed, wiping the water from him lips. 

“So, what happened, buddy?” Tzaad asked. 

“What happened, hah... That’s a long story”, Manu began. “Well, I’m the first clone I’m pretty sure. Manu 2 if you will… I went on missions for the others, their golden boy, I could get anything accomplished. It was a few years in when I was on a mission in the Northern Mountains. I met a wizard who gave me a spell, a cleansing spell. Well I should’ve known there would be strings attached. You see, casting the ritual it cleansed me, but also transferred me to Avernus, the first level of Hell.” Manu stopped, and looked away.

“Hey, it’s okay”, Tzaad said gently, reaching out and clasping Manu’s shoulder.

“Thanks…” Manu said before continuing. “Well I did that and ended up in hell. I ran into the devil believe it or not and we became friends of sorts, Zariel. I joined their ranks and rose to General. I ran that army like a machine for 20 years. It was fine at first, all they fought were other demons. Just waves and waves of them from other dimensions and levels of Hell. It was never ending, and it provided a good diversion to be honest…” Manu trailed off.

“Anyways, then the humans started coming, platoons of them to join the blood wars. I don’t know what stake they had in the battle, but I refused to lead the armies again humans. My mistake I guess, because Zariel turned on me in a second, imprisoning me until I changed my mind. They tortured me for hundreds of years… Might as well have been a million…” Manu finished, tearing up.

Steph cleared her throat and said, “We’re going to go now Manu, and I think you should stay here… You’ve been through a lot”

Manu nodded his head and lay back, “Rest does sound good for once after all these years…”

Steph looked at the others and they all stood, bidding farewell to Manu before heading out. “Where is Michael?” Steph asked aloud.

Just then, Michael rolled around the corner and smiled as he saw them, “Hey guys!”

“Hey Michael!”, Dom said. “Did you have a weird dream last night too by any chance?”

Michael thought for a moment, “Yeah now that you mention it. I was flying above the sea, and suddenly, giant octopi below. Then we had a dance party. Very strange…”

Dom look at the others then back. Steph chimed in, “Why did you join the order? And why did you protect Celestial’s home?”

Michael stroked his chin for a moment before speaking, “Well, Teddy and I, we were together since we were teenagers… It seemed like us versus the world you know. We just did everything together, including wanting to make a name for ourselves. So, we joined the order. I don’t want to go into a ton of detail, but things became strange. We couldn’t talk freely with each other… We knew something was wrong, off, but we never talked about it with each other. We just… took precautions, including enchantments on his sister’s apartment.”

Michael took a breath before continuing, “Well I went on a mission as an emissary to the Eastern Isles, but I encountered the Summer Lady, as I’m sure you’re all familiar with. I ended up here after a series of happenstance and here I say. It was strange coming out of the haze that accompanied being controlled for so long… I just hope I can save Teddy one day.” Michael finished.

“Wow, that’s heavy stuff,” Dom said.

“Heavy indeed. When you’re out there again, please don’t kill my husband. Bring him here, to me…”, Michael pleaded.

Dom shrugged, “We don’t have the best track record in not killing people, but we’ll definitely try!” Dom said hurriedly, seeing the expression on Michael’s face.

 “Right, well Queen Mab expects you, if you’ll follow me”, Michael said, turning and rolling towards the elevators at the push of a lever.

Everyone followed and they took the elevator back down to the main offices. Entering the room they saw a woman stopping by each desk handing out cookies and talking way too much. She eventually made it to them and her gaze fell on Frain.

“Oh my, what a silly bear, would you like a cookie hun?” Karen asked obnoxiously.

“Sure”, Frain answered, shrugging.

Karen booped him on the nose and pulled out her famous, natural 20 peanut butter cookies, handing some to everyone, and booped Frain again before heading off.

“Can I burn her alive?” Frain asked nobody in particular. 

“Yeah, that’s Karen, she’s the floor manager. Level 20 Karen for sure”, Michael explained as they continued.

They piled into another smaller elevator up into the overlook office that Queen Mab was in. Stepping in they saw a hologram of a map of the world hovering above the war table.

Queen Mab looked up and nodded, “Yes, you may go now”.

After a few moments of awkward silence Michael whispered, “She was kidding, come on laugh with me”.

They did, and Tzaad muttered under his breath, “Kill me”.

Queen Mab had a slight smirk on her face now, “I am funny, aren’t eye, please come in.”

 “Let’s get down to business”, Mab began, gesturing at the table. “As you can see we have a number of situations developing across the continent and beyond. Here in the southern mountains we’ve found another stronghold, after 100 years. In Haven, there is a political situation developing, and I have a new contact called the Dame of Dirt in the city that can lead you in the right direction. And in Hell, the blood wars wage but as Milo mentioned, the others have joined the fray for some reason. What are your next steps?”

Everyone looked at each other. “What about hell, we can go fight there, maybe enlist the legions of hell to fight”, Frain chimed in.

“I can’t go back to hell”, Tzaad whispered with menace.

“So that’s a hard pass?” Steph blurted out.
