Dom swayed on his feet for a moment while heading up the steps with Frain.

Frain reached out quickly to steady Dom and asked, “Whoa, are you alright bud?”

“Sorry, almost blacked out there, weird.” Dom replied, looking up into the sky for a moment, as if he were just a character being played by someone in a game, and everything he has ever done has been under the control of this all power entity and he has no real agency. Shaking his head, he continued, “I like the name by the way!”

As Dom approached the rest of the group Mab was gazing at him with eyebrows raised.

“I know, I know, there was a lot, just wish you didn’t all see that”, Dom explained sheepishly.

“Yes, quite a lot indeed. You have a lot of issues you need to work out apparently…” Mab stated.

“Ouch…” Dom retorted.

Dom touched his arm suddenly and looked down at it, noticing that his polyhedron tattoo was gone and smiled.

“Well, who is next then?”, Mab asked suddenly.

Tzaad darted his eyes back and forth quickly and touched his finger to his nose. Steph caught on quickly and touched her nose. Frain looked around confused for a moment before both Steph and Tzaad stepped forward and shoved Frain over the side of the wall. Frain hit the ground hard and stumbled to his feet, shaking his head and his fist up at the others, who were chuckling to themselves.

Mab shook her head and sighed as she walked to the side of the stadium and down the steps, eventually making it to Frain. Walking up to Frain, Queen Mab put her hand on his right shoulder and closed her eyes, once again glowing with an ice blue light. Cold tendrils of power moved through him, poking and prodding until they reached his stomach. Latching onto something, Frain was thrown backwards, and fiery form seeming to burst from his mid-section.

Getting to his feet, Frain saw the Fiery form of a Church of Kossuth priest away from him. “Hey what’s up?”

The form turned to him slowly and smiled, “What’s up indeed.”.

Frain recognized him at once as Nobit Firetongue, the high priest that led the church he trained in all those years ago… His eyes were smoldering cinders, his hair was aflame, and he seemed to radiate heat from all his pores.

“Tell me, Frain… Would you say your journey for Kossuth has been successful so far?” Nobit inquired.

“Uh, sure, I guess… What do you mean successful?” Frain replied.

Nobit walked closer suddenly, “How many have you converted to the faith, what have you given to Kossuth that was worth more than a knick-knack or two?”

“Uh, no and I guess nothing, maybe an axe?” Frain replied uncertainly. 

“Doesn’t look like much success to me”, Nobit spat, getting close to Frain’s face now. “Tell me, if you’re truly devoted to Kossuth, would you make any sacrifice?”

“Of course,” Frain replied without hesitation.

Smiling, Nobit stepped back and waved his hand, a portal appearing and showing Flynn, Frain’s older brother, sitting on the bed looking tired. “How about your brother? Kossuth demands it.”

“Uh, can I talk to him first?” Frain asked.

Stroking the flames of his beard for a moment, Nobit nodded and waved his hand again and stepped aside.

“Flynn? How you are doing buddy?” Frain called out.

Looking around confused for a moment, Flynn tentatively called out, “Frain, is that you little bro?”

“Yeah, what are you doing?” Frain replied.

“Oh, well I was just thinking about how we parted last. I was pretty mean and kind of an idiot. Gwanerra and I aren’t together anymore and that sucks, turns out what you said was true. Sorry about all that bro…” Flynn explained.

“Don’t worry about it”, Frain said. 

“I have to apologize. I’ve always been putting you done because to be honest, I’m weak, and I always have been. All these years and I haven’t amounted to much. I’m just a failure.” Flynn stated. 

“That’s not true! I’ve always looked up to you. You’re the strongest dwarf I know!”, Frain retorted.

“Thanks bro…”, Flynn replied, tears filling his eyes.

Suddenly the portal was closed, and Nobit stepped back in front of Frain. “So, tell me, are you ready to commit this sacrifice?”

“Let me ask this, why?” Frain asked shortly.

“Why shouldn’t matter, but he’s had long enough to provide some value. His final contribution to Kossuth shall be his life”, Nobit explained condescendingly.

“I think he could provide more value alive then dead. We all do. As dwarves we live a long time, and all that potential would be lost if you just killed him. He could still gather followers and bounty for Kossuth for many years to come.” Frain argued precisely.

Nobit stroked his fiery beard again, contemplating Frain’s words. After a minute or so he nodded, “Well argued, I accept your stance. Your brother may live”. Nobit turned a disappeared into a cloud of ash and smoke.

Frain looked around and shrugged, turning to go. Just then, he was wreathed in a ball of fire and screamed. After a few moments the fire disappeared and he was left naked and panting, the straps and bits of his armor having burned off, de-clothing him. 

“I got you bud!”, Dom called out from the stands, casting Fog and wreathing the arena in a thick layer of fog.

“Great, now I’m naked AND I can’t see”, Frain called out.

Waving a bit of fog away from around him, he looked down at his arm and brushes away the ashes of an outline of the polyhedron tattoo on his arm, and it brushed away leaving nothing behind. Frain also felt a warmth in his heart and gained the boon “Gift of Kossuth”. He became permanently fireproof against small, non-magical fires. He also gained advantage on all saving throws against magical fire. 

Frain reached down and scooped up his stuff, before hurrying back up to the stands as the fog dissipated. 

Sighing again, Mab asked, “Who’s next?”

Tzaad takes a swift step forward and shoves Steph into the arena, winning in a strength check against her dexterity save and she went tumbling in, Waffle jumping after her. Steph got up and brushed herself off, glaring up at Tzaad. “I’ll get you for that!”

“You wish!” Tzaad countered. 

“I don’t understand you mortals…” Queen Mab said on her way down the steps again. Reaching out to Steph she laid a hand on her chest and glowed.

Steph felt the cold caress around her heart that clamped and tugged, pulling a shadow from her chest, leaving her gasping for air for a few moments. A shadowy ball appeared in front of her, twirling in the air. After a moment it stretched and became a window, through which she could make out a scene with herself in it as a child.

She was… crying, in an alley. The scene zoomed out and surrounding her were three other children. The boy in front stepped out and kicked at her. Steph fell to her side and curled into a little ball, crying out and holding her head.

“No… Stop…” Steph whisper under her breath, dumbstruck by what she saw.

Suddenly the kids looked to their left down the alley as another girl came running in, golden locks flying behind her, a wild look of fury in her eyes. “Leave Steph alone you dumb bully!”

 It was little Annie, coming to Steph’s Rescue. Standing her ground in front of Steph, Annie jutted her chin out and point at the three kids, “Get outta’ here and I’ll consider letting you live!”

The kids looked around at each other, then laughed. Annie put quite a fight, but in the end the three subdued her and with one final kick at Annie on the ground, they left. Annie propped herself up on one arm and looked back at Steph smiling, her left eye closed and bloody, missing one of her front two teeth. “You and me sis’”.

The window closed and the form took the shape of the swirling shadowy ball once again. After a moment of silence there was a tapping from behind Steph, at the entrance of the arena. Steph looked back and saw a figure holding along, putting a lot of weight on a walking stick. Long flowing golden hair and pointed ears were the easiest features to distinguish her sister Annie, through her bruised and battered body.

“Annie? Is that you?” Steph called out.

Looking up, Annie nodded, tears in her eyes, and she looked away wiping them away, but lost her balance momentarily, stumbling. Steph hurried forward and steadied her. It turned into a warm embrace, tears streaming down Annie and Steph’s eyes.

“You’re okay…” Steph mumbled.

“I’m not sis’… and I don’t know if I ever will be.” Annie stated. “I… I did horrible things. I slaughtered villages. I murdered babies in their crib!”

“Who hasn’t!?” yelled Dom from the arena seats.

Annie looked up confused, then back at Steph, who was staring at her intently.

“That wasn’t you! They were controlling you!” Steph shouted.

Looking away, Annie replied in a trembling voice, “My hands, my body… What does it matter if it was my mind?”

“It’s not your fault!” Tzaad called out, rolling a successful charisma check, inspiring the duo.

Annie wiped at her eyes, “What good has come of any of this? What did I drag you into?”

Steph shrugged and looked around, eyes falling on Waffle, “Well, I found Waffle, and she found me”. Steph looked up into the stands, “And I found… friends, I think…”

Annie’s eyes widened and she laughed out and picked Steph off her feet, twirling her, showing off that signature strength for a moment, forgetting her own wounds. After a few moments she winced and put Steph down, clutching at her cane again. “Friends huh? Amazing, you’ve only ever followed me around. I’m so glad…”

Annie’s eyes widened again, this time in fear and she shouted, tossing Steph aside as the shadow ball formed into a spear and came bolting at Steph’s back. The spear inches from Annie’s heart, Steph cried out and cash Banishment in a split-second decision, sending it to the elemental plane of fire.

Annie opened her eyes, which she closed involuntarily, ready for death. Looking down she patted around her chest, amazing there was no hole. “Wow, where did it go?”

Steph stood up, brushing herself off and looking smug, “I did that.”

“You amaze me sis’!”, Annie proclaimed, bellowing with laughter.

Watching her sister laugh despite her injuries, Steph smiled to herself and felt a calm spread throughout her body. Years of hate, racism, neglect, and fear lifted off her back and her brow. She felt almost weightless, as if these things had been weighing her down her whole life. Steph gained the Boon of Laziness. Her spell book fluttered out from her pack and fluttered around, hooting and hollering with laughter like her sister in her mind, and settling by her side, floating on its’ own. Her spell book would now float around and follow her of its’ own accord. Steph also learned Ward of Disinterest, casting it like a ninth level spell creating a shield that would force those with no business in an area to make a wisdom saving throw to enter. It would last 8 hours on a plot of land up to 30’ in diameter, or up to a year on a building that a wizard is connected to in some way. 

Steph opened her eyes after feeling these calm revelations and saw her sister staring at her. Steph smile and grabbed her by the shoulders and they headed back up into the stands. Looking over Steph saw the tattoo of the polyhedron fade away, and she smiled even wider.

Steph darted her eyes at Tzaad when he came into view and smirked, and she rushed him, trying to sneak attack push him into the arena. Tzaad beat her in a dexterity opposing check and flipped her past him back into the arena. “Oh crap! Sorry!”, Tzaad yelled, and jumped down after her, helping her up.

Steph pulled away embarrassed and brushed herself off, rushing up to the stands again. 

Tzaad shook her head and suddenly realized he was now in the arena. Panicking he turned to run out, but there in front of him was Queen Mab, arms behind her back, passive look on her face. She smirked and reach out one hand and settled in on Tzaad’s shoulder.

Tzaad felt the piercing cold caress of her power jolt through his body, settling on his brain and tugging, seeming to dislodge something that was latched on. He screamed and collapsed. A moment later he came to. Standing in front of him was a human man.

Stoic and commanding, he stood there, a stern look on his face. He was wearing his Hellriders uniform and paladin regalia. “Attention, soldier!”

Tzaad shot up ramrod straight and a salute slapped his forehead before he had time to blink.

“At ease, and chin up”, Lt. Mal said, smirking and walking around Tzaad, inspecting him.

“Sir, what are you doing here?” Tzaad ask.

“Well, this is going to sound weird, and it’s what they told me to say, but I’m the Ghost of a Tzaad Past. I know, trust me”, Lt. Mal explained, shrugged in apology. “I’m here for you today, so let’s begin.” Lt. Mal waved his behind next to Tzaad and a window into the past opened.

Tzaad was just a child, poor, working hard on his father’s farm… Tzaad in the present looked away, he knew what came next… Years of his father drinking and beating him and his mother. His mother leaving… Eventually Lt. Mal showed up when he was 16, and bought his commission from his father, conscripting him into the Hellriders. 10 years of training later, he’s made it into the Filthy Raiders (Raider’s squad of the 5th platoon), and they were going on their first mission, scouting!

“What are you seeing, Tzaad?” Lt. Mal asked, searching Tzaad’s face.

Tzaad forced himself to look back into the window and saw a familiar scene. “I see us… Getting slaughtered. We were in Avernus; we were just scouting but we got into a skirmish. They came out of nowhere…” Tzaad eyes began to fill with tears as he recalled the day. “They were all killed, all but me… You too! You got me out! Why?”

“I just couldn’t bear to lose another soldier, a… son perhaps”, Lt. Mal replied, turned away and clearing his throat. “Ahem, what else do you see?”

“I drank… I whored… I couldn’t get it out of my head. I eventually lost everything and ended up at the Order of the Polyhedron. I thought I might be able to start over there.”, Tzaad said.

The scene in the window changed to a dead man and girl, shape-changers in Graymoor. “And this?” Mal asked.

“I didn’t get there in time…”, Tzaad whispered, voice trembling.

The scene flicked through the dead baby in the tenements, the dead grandparent in the mountains, the pile of bodies at the Red Roost. “And these!?”, Mal shouted, almost screaming in Tzaad face. “All you do is leave bodies in your wake, you’re not worthy of this life, all you do is seem to take! What do you have to say for yourself!?”

Lt. Mal grabbed Tzaad by the scruff of the neck and thrust his face at the window as it flashed over every body left in his wake. “Who do you want to be!? What do you want to accomplish!?”

“I don’t know…” Tzaad grated out, as he felt a tug on his mind, something pulling.

Lt. Mal brought his voice to a gentle projection, “Let go Tzaad, be free.”

“I… Can’t. It’s all I have…” Tzaad sobbed out.

“You have more now. Friends… Live for them, don’t live for us, the ones your lost…”, Mal said.

“Live for yourself!” Steph yelled from the stands, banging on the side of the arena, caught up in the passion of the moment.

“Yeah… I’ll live for myself…” Tzaad whispered at first, then he said it again, louder and stronger, “I’ll live for myself!”

Tzaad suddenly felt and immense pressure release from his mind. He turned towards the window and it shattered. Looking back, Lt. Mal was gone. Tzaad’s madness was gone it seemed, he was no longer bound by its’ constraints. He was free. Tzaad fell to his knees, gently weeping. 

Steph jumped down and ran over to Tzaad, kneeling and hugging him. Dom called out, “Group hug!”, and jumped down after her, along with Frain, and they all came in for a hug, Waffle even joining.

Tzaad stood up, pulling away and wiping his tears. “Hey man, that was cool…” a voice in a smooth, jazzy, Kenny G tenor said in his head. “Aww man, there was a block and I couldn’t get through, oh yeah… But here you are, it’s gone… Your neurons are all firing again. My man…”

Tzaad looked around confused until he realized it was his shield! “It’s you, Hard Pass senpai!”

Tzaad has unlocked the ability to play smooth jazz in his head on demand, and in elevators for everyone. Suddenly, he began to bleed out of his ears and eyes. He started freaking out before he realized he felt more alleviation from this, and wiping it away, he saw his tattoo had been a bloody outline, and wiping it away removed it for good!

Tzaad gained the Boon of Blood. When he concentrates, he can smell the presence of fresh blood within a 20 foot radius. Also, in moments of extreme duress, he can manifest an aura of intimidation that’s visible only to his enemies, born of bloodlust or desperation, it forces all his enemies that can see him to succeed on a DC 10 wisdom saving throw or flee from him at max speed.

Queen Mab walked into the arena, nodding in satisfaction. She looked down at her watch suddenly as it beeped and looked back up. “Every out now!”.

Everyone got up and ran out of the arena, heeding an immortal god’s words and went up into the stands. Moments later a tear in the fabric of spacetime opened in the arena and widened into a gash. Tumbling through came a large horned devil, wings furled around it as it’s back hit the ground of the arena with a thud. The wings unfurled and they saw a figure with two blades stabbed into it’s chest backflip off with a natural 20 initiative. It was Milo, the rogue they met on the airship!

The devil got back up and screamed, rushing Milo and nailing her with its tail. Poisoned and not looking good, Milo flipped her daggers backwards and darted around the devil at blinding speed, slashing at its Achille’s tendons and the back of its knees. Sliding back, she took one final charge and sliced off it’s legs at the knees, and the devil fell to the ground screaming, and gushing blood dying on the arena floor. Milo collapsed and put her back against the arena wall, catching her breath and holding her profusely bleeding side.

Everyone jumped in once the shield around the arena fell, and Dom rushed over, casting a healing spell. As the portal closed, Tzaad looked over and noticed a figure slumped on the ground. He rushed over and looked down, recognizing Manu, albeit looking much older and desiccated, body covered in overlapping scars from head to toes. 

Tzaad cried out and picked Manu up gently. “Manu, what happened?”

“Tzaad, is that you?”, Manu croaked out, cracking one eye half open.

Frain walked over and healed Manu, stabilizing him.

“What happened buddy…” Tzaad muttered, close to Manu’s face.

“It was… I was…. Tortured, for so long…” Manu replied weakly, before passing out again.

Milo stood up wincing. “I rescued him from Avernus, when I just teleported from. He was being tortured there.”

Everyone looked shocked and stared at Manu.

“I don’t believe this is a Manu you know.” Milo turned to Queen Mab and stood at attention.

“Your report?”, Queen Mab asked.

“The kingdom of the Eastern Isles has been taken by the others, Sagh escaped to the Summer Court, Manu reported dead.” Milo began.

Everyone gasped in horror at this news, Tzaad yelling “No!”.

Pushing forward Milo said, “He told me he was Manu 2 of sorts, the first clone. Featherwind remains in Faerie. Haven is a hotbed of political disruption, and assassination attempts. Scholar’s Spire in the center of the city has dropped it’s shield after 400 years and nobody knows why just yet.” Milo cleared her throat and continued, “An ‘Other’ stronghold has been found in the Southern Mountains by my Longstrider Scouts.”

“Great! The first we have found in 100 years just about”, Queen Mab cut in.

“Yes, and I’ll send more scouts for a recon mission. In Avernus, Zariel fights the endless blood war, but the others are fighting for control of the River Styx. With control of that they may be able to take the first circle of hell. And my Snow Leopard scouts have not reported from the northern mountains in weeks, it’s quiet there and we are blind.” Milo finished.

Nodding, Queen Mab took this alone in and looked at the other, “You should all get some rest, come”, as she turned and strode from the arena.

Everyone followed, Tzaad carrying Manu, Annie sticking close to Steph, and Michael bringing up the rear. They went up a freight elevator and to the West Castle Spire, a housing spire with 4 floors of 4 rooms each. Milo bowed out, retiring to her private quarters in a nearby tower.

Steph got to work stealing pillows and headed into a room with Annie and Waffle. Celestial grabbed a room on the second floor. Frain grabbed one on the first and gave a quick prater to Kossuth. Tzaad carried Manu into a room on the first and sat with him, deep in thought, falling asleep once the medical staff arrived. 

Before going to sleep everyone had a chat with their sentient items. New boons were gained now that they were all level 10. Frain’s CrossFire got +5 fire damage on successful attacks. Tzaad’s Hard Pass can morph its form and gave +10 permanent health. Dom morphed his mace into a Guan Dao spear and on hits it heals him for 1d6. Steph’s spell book gave her the ability to dispel it’s magic once per long rest as a bonus action, meaning she can cast a spell as a bonus action.

The next morning Milo woke up and reported to Queen Mab at the war table, running into Karen on the way there and getting some peanut butter cookies. Munching on them on the way there, Milo rolled for cookies, and got a natural 20. They were delicious. Karen made some damn fine peanut butter cookies.

“Reporting for duty, ma’am!” Milo called out, walking into the room. “What is my next mission?”

Queen Mab debriefed her, “I need you to personally go to the Northern Mountains to figure out what’s going on. After that, report to Haven to help disrupt some of the political turmoil.”

Saluting, Milo headed out, no time to waste, “Tell the guys I’ll join up later!”

“Me Speed”, Queen Mab called out.

Milo turned back, confused, “What’s that?”

“You know, “Me” Speed… Because I’m God!” Queen Mab explained a little desperate.

Milo turned and walked out without saying anything.

“Everyone’s a critic”, Queen Mab murmured, and turned back to the war table.
