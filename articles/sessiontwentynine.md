Dara took measure of the carnage she just witnessed and nodded. “Well done, you guys are stronger than you looked”.

“Thanks?” Tzaad replied, slightly offended.

“I think we should probably take a quick rest before moving on. We need to replenish our high-level spells, including Frain’s plane shift so we can get back”, Steph said.

“That makes sense”, Dom agreed. “How do you suppose we do it while in hell?”

“Well, I have a spell called Magnificent Mansion. I can create a portal to an extra-dimensional mansion we can rest in! Nobody else can get in!” Steph explained excitedly.

“Will there be food and whatnot at this mansion?” Tzaad asked, trying to remain calm.

“Uh, yeah, I think so”, Steph replied.

Nodding solemnly, Tzaad turned towards the cavern wall and started walking towards the tunnels, “Let us do it then.”

“Um, is the tunnel to the left, Tzaad”, Dara called out behind him.

Tzaad changed his trajectory slightly left and continued walking, “I knew that”.

Everyone followed, but shortly before entering the tunnel there was a boom and loud crash. Looking up they saw a huge rock from the cavern wall hurtling towards them, having broken free from some kind of impact. Yelling, everyone ducked and dodged, but only Steph and Waffle managed to move quickly enough, Waffle grabbing Dara and pulling her along.  

Frain held his knee at the mouth of the tunnel, “Tss… ah… I think my leg is broken, dammit”, Frain exclaimed through gritted teeth. 

“Alright bud, here we go”, Dom assured, reaching down, and helping Frain up. “Probably just a sprain you’ll be fine!”

“Steph… sister…” Steph looked around wildly. “Annie? Did anyone else just here that?”

“Hear what?” Manu asked, puzzled.

Shrugging, Steph stepped over to the side of the tunnel, “Nothing, I guess. I’ll get this portal set up.” 

Dom looked over at Frain, twirling his finger next to his temple. Frain chuckled but they both went quiet and straightened up when Steph turned back and threw them a dirty look.

Searching through her coat of many pockets, Steph pulled out odds and ends as reagents, setting up for her spell, before casting Magnificent Mansion. Ahead of her, a swirling purple vortex took shape in midair. Flourishing her hands, Steph waved everyone in, “Alright, quickly, let’s get inside!”

Everyone shuffled through, Tzaad was first. What greeted him inside was a mansion that looked as though it was made entirely from pillows. The couches, tables, chandeliers, guard rails, stairs. Everything was pillows! “Uh, I know you like pillows and all, but this is…” Tzaad was cut off by the sight of an extraordinary banquet set up in the middle of the grand hall. Rushing forward he grabbed food wildly, shoving it into his mouth.

“Make yourself at home…” Steph said as she walked in, closing the portal behind her.

Lining the walls and stairs were semi-transparent servant dressed in what looked to be butler and maid style pajamas. “Welcome ma’am, may I take your coat?” one of the servants said, shuffling up to Steph.

“Uh, no, but could you give Waffle a bath, she probably hasn’t had one since she was born…” Steph replied.

Waffle shot Steph a dirty look as she was led off by the servant. Before heading to sleep, everyone handed off their clothes, weapons, and armor to be washed and oiled by the servants. After a long rest, everyone regathered at the entrance, preparing to head back out. Steph nodded at everyone before reopening the portal.

“Allow me…” Tzaad said, stepping out first, ducking and rolling with mighty stealth. “Caw, Caw!” Tzaad called out after ensuring the coast was clear.

“What’s he doing?” Dara asked.

A few of the devils in the sky stopped fighting for a moment and looking around, “Oy, Jerry, you hear that?”

“It’s just crows you nit wit, a murder of crows”, Jerry replied.

“Oh, I love a good murder of crows…” The other devil replied before attacking again.

Manu shrugged, “Maybe he’s got something stuck in his throat? Hey Tzaad, you okay?”

“Oh, for the love of… It is all clear. Come out here.” Tzaad replied, exasperated.

Everyone walked out into the tunnel and Steph closed the portal behind them.

“You know, all you devil folk l look alike, so creepy”, Tzaad said to Dara unprompted.

Dara rounded on Tzaad, “Look, I know you have a problem with devils, and you seem to have been hostile to me since we got here. Just for your information, I am half archdevil, half human, so at least get that right. And if it were not for my mother controlling the legions of hell, your stupid realm would be overrun! So, you should be thanking me!”

“Now listen here you little…” Tzaad began pointing his finger, before being cut off by Steph.

“Cut it out, alright. Tzaad you are a grown man, leave this kid alone. We need to get moving anyways.” Steph interjected.

Tzaad retracted his finger slowly before following the others down the tunnel. The tunnel was about 20 feet wide and 100 feet long. At the end of it they seemed to end up in another canyon, surrounded by tunnels in the walls.

After a moment of concentration, Dara pointed to the right, “It’s that tunnel”.

Inside the next tunnel they saw about halfway down a group of bearded devils. Dom cast fog cloud on them, causing confusion and allowing them to sneak past. On his way by, Frain almost got him from one of them blindly flailing.

At the next canyon, Dara pointed them to a tunnel up on the cliff face, about 20 feet high. After some finesse and ropes, everyone climbed up and into the tunnel. As far as they could tell, the tunnel was clear. The group walked about fifty feet before they heard a crashing and rumbling getting louder.

“Uh guys, what is that?” Frain asked nervously.

“I don’t…” Tzaad began.

Suddenly the tunnel wall to their right collapsed in, and behind it was a large earth elemental, having just pummeled its way through the tunnel. Behind it they could see a hole through tunnels back to the starting canyon.

Our heroes were locked in combat. Quickly assessing the situation, Steph noted an earth elemental, 2 spined devils, 3 imps, 8 goblins, a hideous, tentacled xorn, and an imposing looking dao.  

Waffle started off with pack tactics helping her deliver a devastating frost breath, taking down several goblins. Dom follow up with a ground smash radiating thunder damage that took out all the goblins, the imps and the spined devils.

“Holy crap dude, good job!” Tzaad called out excitedly before jumping into the fray and going at the earth elemental.

Steph cast Phantasmal Horror on the elemental, incapacitating it with horror and dealing period damage, “Alright let’s focus on the dao!”

The Earth elemental screamed… It saw visions of the seaside. He was a cliff and the waves, they rushes at him ceaselessly, wearing him down… Nobody can hear his screams…

Waffle took the xorn’s tentacles with a mighty bite that felled it. Tzaad began working on the Dao. Steph used lightning bolt to deal massive damage.

The elemental screamed again. It realized it was going to die here. He remembers his wide and little earth elemental kids. They will never see their dad again. It was little ferrite’s birthday tomorrow… He said he would take her to the mountains… 

The dao retreated and cast summon elemental, bringing another earth elemental into being.

“You’re… marbleous”, Dom proclaimed.

This elicited groans from everyone in the party.

Everyone focused their final effort on the dao, finally killing him, and with his death, the two elementals in play disappeared, dispersed by the lack of focus on their energy.

Catching his breath, Dom waved the others along. “Go, I’ll close up this hole they made!”

The others hurried away as Dom prepared and cast Shatter, causing a cave in. He realized almost too late he should have moved out of the way and rolled well enough to get out in time before the whole tunnel collapsed. 

“Whoa, I feel like I had a 5% chance of dying back there”, Dom exclaimed, a little scared, a little excited.

The group made their way to the end of the tunnel, coming into a cave instead of a canyon with a large, stone door on the wall. There were two small holes at their height with something inscribed above them. 

Frain moved forward peering at the message, “It’s written in Celestial, and I can read that! It says, ‘Here lie the Filthy Five, Long Live the Hellriders’”.

Tzaad nodded, “We’re in the right place alright.”

 Dara stepped forward and moved past Frain, “I got this…”

She shoved her hands with the bands of mourning into the holes, and almost immediately there was a grinding noise and the walls began to shake before beginning to shift open from the middle. Dara pulled her hands out quickly and stepped back as the mournful echoes of souls emanated from the tomb.
