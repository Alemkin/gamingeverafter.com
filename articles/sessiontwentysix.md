As the ringing in Frain’s ears subsided and the riddle rang out, the group fell into an awkward silence.

“…Maybe it’s a satyr!” Tzaad exclaimed, startling everyone.

“You’re a satyr.” Dom retorted, shaking his head.

Tzaad shrugged and looked over at Steph, “What does your big wizard brain think?”

Steph held two fingers to her temple and rolled a d20, landing a critical fail (1) and looked up, shrugging. “Yeah history is not my forte”.

Frain shook his head, stood up, and looked around, “Maybe the details are in the books everywhere? They are all bleeding too, what’s up with that?” He looked around at blank faces. “Alright maybe we should take a quick rest before venturing further in”.

The group agreed and they unpacked for a short rest. Tzaad pulled out his sword and followed his martial formations, getting in some practice. Suddenly, Dom jumped in with his mace and took a swing. Tzaad ducked out of the way and brought his sword in an upward arc that Dom barely blocked. 

“Let’s see what you got bud”, Dom challenged.

The two circled each other and began a performative sparring session. Unfortunately the opening was the more impressive, both rolling pretty low performance checks the spectacle was best described as “boring”.

“Boo”, Frain called, munching on popcorn he had procured from somewhere. “You guys done fuckin’ about? Let us move on”

“Just hyping up”, Tzaad replied, straightening his back and shrugging his shoulders.

They packed up and continues down the corridor of bleeding books, darkness just on the edge of their vision, a high-pitched whine on the edge of hearing no one could quite place. Eventually they came to a turn in the corridor, and straight ahead, embedded in the bookshelves, was a door.

Steph stepped forward holding up he hand, Waffle close behind. “I’ve got this one at least, let’s see… Everything seems okay, no traps I can see”. Steph looked back over her should and Frain threw her two thumbs up before she turned back and opened the door.

Inside was a large room, surrounded by bookshelves, with a podium in the middle. On the podium was a single book. Steph walked up to the podium and scrutinized it, perceiving there was a button under the book. “Hey guys, I think we need to swap this book out or something, this might be the book we’re looking for!”

“I got this!” Tzaad called as he ran to a bookshelf and pulled off a book that looked about the same size. As he did this, the floor began to rumble and shake, and a deep moaning emanated from deep in the library. “Oh crap, here, quick!” Tzaad cried, tossing the book to Steph, who reached for the book on the podium to swap it, and pulled, realizing the book was glued to the button after it was too late!

As she did this, the floor lurched upwards suddenly, launching everyone into the ceiling, which turned out to be a gelatinous cube, engulfing them in its sticky, jelly body!

Writhing around frantically, Dom, Tzaad, Frain, Waffle, and Celestial break out. Waffle and Dom both rolled natural 20s, allow them to grab Steph and Frain respectively with an extra roll on the way out, freeing everyone from the acidic grasp of the gelatinous cube! 

As everyone hit the floor and stood shakily to their feet, another rumble rocked everyone but Celestial prone, as suddenly through the entrance to the room, two hideous beholders burst in, screeching and turning their terrible eyes on the group.

The Beholders began using their powers by casting rays of varying abilities at our heroes. Tzaad struggled to his feet, only to be turned to stone mid swing at the nearest beholder. Celestial yelled out in fury as she was flung backwards and pinned to a bookshelf. Steph was able to get a classic fireball off, dealing decent damage but having her abilities slowed, eliminating her bonus actions.

Dom was unfortunate enough to be staring point blank into the gaping maw of one of the beholders, who decided to chomp down on him every chance he got. 

“May Kossuth have mercy on your soul”, Frain whispered to himself in reverence as he cast bless on the group, everyone gaining a helpful boon in their struggle.

Waffle was able to dart in and out with bites, as well as a frost breath, until eventually, the beholders succumbed to the power of the adventurers.

“Phew, that was harder than usual guys… You think the enemies are getting stronger or something?” Steph commented.

Tzaad shrugged and walked over to the podium, “I’m just going to grab the book and we can get out of here…”

Everyone but Frain makes it out of the room before Tzaad grabs the book again, launching them both up. Tzaad and Frain grab onto the podium at the last second before being flung into the ceiling.

“What in the 9 hells…” Tzaad muttered, opening the book up to see what was inside. Upon close inspection, he noticed all the pages were blank!

“Well, this was a waste of time…” Frain said, shaking his head. 

Exiting, the group gathered up and headed further down the corridor, along the bend. After several more minutes of wandering they came across a fork, and a door embedded in the bookshelves directly ahead of them again, in the middle of the fork. 

They looked at it suspiciously when suddenly all were stricken with a terrible fear, and only Frain rolled high enough to avoid succumbing. With his friends writhing on the floor in fear of some unsee able horror, a cloaked and masked figure peeked out from the doorway and stepped in front of him. The cloak was all black and the mask a cow’s skull.

“Leave now, or I shall kill you.” A deep voice from behind the mask proclaimed calmly.

“No bud, we want a book”, Frain retorted.

Looking back over its shoulder then back at Frain, it nodded, “Right, the item you seek is behind that door… Enter, and I shall kill you”. With those words, the figure stepped back through the doorway and shut it.

Everyone, shaking off the fear, was able to get up after a few minutes and Frain filled them in. 

“Well, let’s give him have a piece of our mind!” Tzaad cried, pointing at the door.

Shrugging, Frain stepped forward and knocked a few times. After a few seconds, the figure stepped out again, Frain taking several steps backwards.

“Hello again, I see your friends are back in action. Can I help you?”, the figure asked.

“Yeah, who are you?” Steph called out. 

“My name is Tesseract, though it may not mean anything to you”, Tesseract replied. “Have you made your decision?”

“Yeah!” Tzaad yelled, striking with his sword from behind… and finding it go straight through Tesseract’s incorporeal form.

Tesseract chuckled and disappeared.

“Well, that wasn’t exactly as planned…” Tzaad muttered, kicking his feet in the dirt.

“Alright, let’s get this over with”, Dom said, stepping forward and opening the door.

Everyone stepped through into a long hall, 50 by 80 feet, with a raised platform at the end of the hall and a throne on it. On the throne lay a skull with three diamonds inlaid into its mouth and eyes. Stepping forward cautiously, they neared the center of the hall when a sudden wave of nausea swept through them, causing necrotic damage, and launching our adventurers into a battle for their lives!
