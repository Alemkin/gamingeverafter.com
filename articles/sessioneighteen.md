As the horses touched back down on the ground, our adventurers paused for a moment, unsure of what to do next.

“Hmm, the warthog is hard to spot…”, Frain said, looking around for tracks.

“Like my ex-wife!” Tzaad replied.

“Wait, you were married, Tzaad?”, Steph asked, incredulous.

Tzaad ignored this and had his horse move forward, using a survival check to find some tracks. He located several crisscrossing tracks, some of which were certainly those of a warthog, but he couldn’t pinpoint exactly which.

Frain pulled up on his horse and peered down, rolling an incredible natural 20 on investigation, immediately able to tell the exact track they needed. “This way you guys, I found them!”, he said, as he started following the tracks, the others close behind, and the wild hunt in tow.

Clip clopping down the hedge maze, Steph was flipping through her spell book, contemplating her spells. “Ah! Guys, I just remembered a spell I have, to locate animals. I think it could come in handy if we’re within 1000 feet of the warthog.” 

“Wait! The tracks disappear into the bushes of the hedge here”, Frain said, stopping suddenly and pointing.

Everyone hopped down off their horrible horses to get a closer look. After some discussion, Steph shuffled through her 11 pockets in her cloak.

A loud scream echoed out of one, “Whoops, wrong pocket”, Steph said, flustered, closing the pocket quickly, and finding her components pocket, pulling out some bloodhound hair and materials for her locate animal.

Sitting on the ground and concentrating for a few moments with her eyes closed, Steph opened her eyes, the hair burning up into ash in her hand and floating away. She became aware of snorting and shuffling about 100 feet into the bush, certainly the animals they were looking for.

“Standing up, Steph announced, “Yeah, they are that way. Thing is, how do we get in?”

The gears of his brain working hard, Tzaad nodded to himself, and took stealthy steps towards the bush, starting to push himself in. Immediately he began to feel tendrils of vines grabbing at him, pulling him deeper. He tried pulling away, but they constricted harder and he eventually got stuck about 5 feet in.

“Uh, guys”, Tzaad called, unsure what to do”

“Hang on!” Dom called, reaching in and heaving to try and pull Tzaad back out, managing to get his head poking back out.

Struggling, Tzaad decided to pull back into the bushes and try to get to the other side. A few strength checks later, he was able to pull free on the grasping vines and emerged in a clearing about 50 feet in diameter, shaking the leaves off him. Dusting himself off, he froze as he noticed a warthog in the dead center of the clearing, about half his size, rooting around. A glint of glee ran through his eye and he reached for his rope, whispering under his breath, “Let’s get this rodeo started…”

On the other side, Steph called out, “Tzaad, are you okay?”

After receiving no answer, she shrugged and turned to the others. “So uh, should we burn it?” Steph asked, side eying Frain as she said it.

Frain shrugged as the Erlking began chuckling behind them, nudging some of his posse, and chuckling with them.

“Okay, what’s so funny!?” Steph asked, annoyed.

“It’s just amusing watching mortals try too hard. Just go with the flow!”, the Erlking replied, still chuckling.

“Go with the flow? What does that mean?” Frain asked.

“It means what it means”, The Erlking replied cryptically. “I could also just get you through, for a price”, he continued.

“No, no way!”, Steph began.

“What are the terms?”, Frain asked.

Looking over at Frain, the Erlking hopped off his horse, ignoring Steph’s protests and walked over to Frain, bending down to whisper into his ear, where nobody else could hear. “It’s simple, I’m not asking much. After the hunt, if you would retire to a room in the palace with me for an hour or two and help me fulfill an itch I have… You see, I like to be verbally abused and I think you’d be great at it. It’s so hard to find people around here to help with that kind of stuff, you know? Just think about it”, the Erlking let all of this out in a seemingly frantic whisper before clearing his throat and brushing himself off, looking hopefully at Frain. 

Frain, a little dumbfounded, regained his composure and cleared his throat, “Uh, let me uh, think about it…”

As he mulled this over, Tzaad has tied his rope into a lasso and began to creep towards the warthog. Successfully sneaking about halfway to the warthog, he rolled a quick dexterity check, successfully throwing the lasso over the warthog’s neck. The warthog immediately began running in the opposite direction, the lasso going taught and Tzaad straining his muscles to redirect it. So began the wrangling. The warthog spun around, a few strength checks successfully getting the warthog running straight at Tzaad. This was it; he could see the red of its eyes flashing.

Meanwhile, the others had decided to link hands and paws and fall back into the bush, just “going wit the flow”. Linking hands, Frain, Steph, Dom, and Waffle stepped back into the hedge wall, nervously allow the vines to pull them through.

Steph felt Waffle begin to struggle a bit, but she soothed her.

 After a few moments they closed their eyes, feeling one with the bush, the gentle caress of leaves and vines lulling them. Rolling for bush, Dom was the only to roll a 20 or higher, and he felt at peace. He did not know where the bush ended, and he began…

After a few more moments they suddenly fell back into the clearing, hearing a loud squealing and a roaring, “Yee-haw!”, from Tzaad. Looking back, they saw the warthog charging right at him, and he stepped aside, grabbing it out of the air with a successful dexterity check and tossing it on it’s back, throwing another successful athletics check and hogtying it with the rope.

Panting, Tzaad looked up towards the others who were staring at him as he wiped sweat from his brow. Squinting he noticed that all the hair on Steph, Frain and Waffle was a deep and shimmering forest green. 

Confused for a moment, Tzaad, Waffle, and Steph suddenly swiveled their heads towards Tzaad’s right, into the bush wall, noticed a much louder squealing and snorting, a rumble beneath their feet. A moment later, a gigantic warthog, three times the size of Waffle, burst out of the bushes. It swiveled it’s one good red eye, the size of Frain’s head, over in the direction of the tied warthog and Tzaad, it’s other eyes scarred over I crisscrossing lines.

Squealing in fury, it began a beeline charge at Tzaad in the middle, locking everyone in combat.

Waffle ran over to its side, howling out a blast of Frost Breath, but seeming to have no effect.

Frain stepped forward and pointed, his body giving off a blast of heat as he cast Fireball near the giant warthog. Despite a direct hit engulfing its body, it also seemed to have no effect!

“Oh crap”, Frain said.

Tzaad stepped in, stabbing with his rapier, dealing a good amount of damage, but taking some fire damage in return.

Steph attempted to cast modify memory but failed as the warthog was able to resist.

The warthog, swiveling its good eye down where Tzaad had run up to it, and swept one gnarly tusk down at him, hooking it into his ribs and picking him up off the ground, goring him.

Tzaad, surprised, took 51 damage and began to hack up pools of blood. “Whoa guys, this is not as comfortable as it looks!” Tzaad called out to the others, in between hacking up blood.

Steph turned to her side, vomiting up her last meal, thoroughly disgusted by what just happened.

Dom ran up to the warthog’s right side, reaching out and casting inflict wounds, dealing massive damage, and taking some fire damage in retaliation.

Waffle took a began to bite at its leg, taking a chunk out, taking some fire damage, but also regaining a bit of health after chewing and swallowing the bite, realizing she was hungry, and went back for seconds.

Frain threw a guiding bolt to more affect than his previous fireball.

Tzaad grasped the tusk with both hands and screamed as he was able to muster enough strength to de-gore himself and fell to the ground. He stumbled to his feet, holding his side and coughing up for more blood. 

Steph cast reduce, bringing the warthog down to the size of Waffle, decreasing its stats.

The warthog swiveled its reduced gaze to Dom, and shoved its other tusk into his guts, lifting him slightly off the ground. It took some lighting damage from his charged aura as he screamed out in pain.

Dom immediately tried to free himself but failed.

Waffle took another feasting bite, doing the same fire damage and health gaining dance.

Frain cast a healing spell on Tzaad, trying to bring him back from the brink of death.

Tzaad, feeling a little better, used second wind and ran in again, using his rapier to deal some more damage.

Steph cast a lightning bolt, and at this point the warthog was looking a little worse for wear.

The warthog shook its head, but Dom held on for dear life and was able to avoid taking more damage.

Dom was able to successfully pull himself off the tusk, taking a few steps back to recover his balance.

Waffle took another chomp, feasting.

Tzaad went in for the kill, rolling two natural 1s in a row, and successfully skewering the beast right up the bum, but losing his rapier in the process as it melted on the way through.

Breathing heavily, and thoroughly annoyed at losing the rapier he took a shit of shit for, Tzaad looked back checking that the other warthog was still alive and struggling in the middle of the clearing and sighing in relief. 

Clapping and grinning, the Erlking walked up behind them. Pulling his mask up he said, “Truly amazing battle, a fine display of valor. I thought we were going to have to step in there for a minute, but that beast has been around for a very long time and you dispatched her expertly! In Fact, this deserves a blessing”.

The Erlking stepped back, tossing his hair back and raising his arm, closing his eyes. He glowed with a soft green light for a moment. The group felt a rush of heat move up through their bodies and were imbued with 9 charges of “Balm of the Summer Court”.

Sighing in happiness, the Erlking opened his eyes and winked at Frain, “Offer still stands”, before strutting back to his horse and the rest of the wild hunt. “Come on, we’ll escort you back to the palace”, he called back, and hopped on his horse. 

Agreeing, Tzaad borrowed Steph’s quarterstaff and strung up the warthog, getting help from Dom to carry it back to his horse and tying it on.

They all realized their horses were smiling at them, remembering that they unfortunately had the faces of gnomes and elves. As the group began off, they realized suddenly that the clip-clopping noises were being made by their horses’ mouths, as they vocalized it. 

Ahead of them, the hedge maze seemed to sway and shimmer in reaction to the Erlking’s presence.

“Uhm, do you need a cough drop”, Steph asked her horse as it didn’t stop making the noise.

Turn its head back and staring at Steph, it smiled creepily and replied, “No, thank you.” Then it returned its gaze ahead and resumed it’s vocalizing of neighing and clip clopping.

Steph sat up a little straighter, extremely uncomfortable.

After a half hour or so of riding, they came upon a break in the hedge wall and the walls of the crystal palace loomed ahead of them. Tzaad recognized the fountain in the courtyard he popped out of back at the spa.

“Here you are fellow hunters. I’d rather not be swept up in any more politics, so I’ll be going. Enjoy the feast!”, the Erlking announced, and took off, the wild hunt in tow.

“So uh, you and the Erlking huh?” Tzaad asked Frain, smiling.

Shrugging, Frain walked towards the entrance, and the others followed sharing a quick look of raised eyebrows and more shrugs.

Steph walked up to the door and was about to knock, but it swung open before she could, and a nymph in a black and white suit greeted them, “Welcome, welcome, the princess is expecting you. Come, come!” She waved her hands and started hurrying away from the door, looking back to make sure they followed.

In the entryway was a grand staircase leading straight up the middle, with staircases on either side as well going up the walls to the next landing. They were led behind the grand staircase to a familiar looking crystal door and headed into the throne room they had been in several times before.

As usual, on the throne sat Princess Dandelion, who was whispering back and forth with Sagh about something. When she noticed them come in, she looked up and smiled, “Amazing, the warthog, just what I wanted, oh delightful!”, she exclaimed as she clapped. “Well, bring it here!”, she demanded.

Tzaad and Dom stepped forward, and two servants rushed up, swapping it to another stick, giving Steph her quarterstaff back, and rushing off through a side door.

“Wait, that’s my rope!”, Tzaad called after them ineffectually, as the door closed behind them.

Dom leaned over and whispered to a sullen looking Tzaad, “It’s okay, I got you bro, you can have my rope.”

“Oh thank you, now, go get some rest before the feast, as it is tonight!” Dandelion exclaimed.

“Wait, what do we wear? Tis this okay?”, Tzaad asked, gesturing at his blood-soaked studded armor.

“It’s chic, I like it. Go with what you all feel!”, the princess replied. “Now go, rest, dress. Sagh, please escort them”, she continued.

Sagh sighed and stepped down the staircase and walked past them, “Come on, your rooms are this way.”

The group followed back out to the entrance and up the right side of the grand staircase, and down a hallway to the right. At the end of the hallway they turned left.

“Okay, any of these doors are fine, they should have everything you need”, Sagh explained, and turned to go.

“Wait, where can I find more pillows?” Steph called out in question to Sagh.

Shrugging her shoulder, Sagh gestured to the other room, “Take what you need from the vacant ones”.

Tzaad opened the first door and headed in, coming into an ornate bedroom with a wash basin in the back, the same as the other room. He undressed and began to practice some new maneuvers, crudely drawing his thoughts into a journal.

Steph headed into the next, peeking out after the others went into their rooms, and hurrying around gathering pillows.

Frain headed into his room, praying to Kossuth before heading to bed.

Dom headed into the last room, cleaning his wounds and clothing before turning in.

Steph rang a bell by her door, and a servant showed up. “Oh, hello, can you help me find something to wear for tonight?” Steph asked the servant.

Nodding, the servant rushed off and came back with a large chest of clothing and dragged it into the room. Steph and the nymph montaged through all the clothing before she finally settling on something. Steph looked at the clothing, nodding in satisfaction before plopping into bed and nodding off to sleep.

And so our adventurers drifted off to dreamland in the land of Faerie, hoping that their next wakeful hours would bring more good news and favorable conditions for them…
