Mylo opened her eyes. It was a good thing she did not have to sleep, because she did not think she would be able to anyways. Even while meditating, she would always keep one eye open. On the run since she was ten, living in the wild with her brother. Stealing every night just to live another day… 

Mylo sighed and stood before grabbing her cloak and headed out. She stopped for a moment by the door, eyeing a silver spoon on the table next to her. She pocketed it and closed the door behind her. Scratching her chin, she looked around, thinking about Frain. Suddenly, there was the strong scent of lavender from a particular direction. Sniffing the air, she followed it to a door down a few hallways. She looked around then opened the door quietly and slipped in.

Frain turned over, yawning, and cracked his eyes open. Stretching he kicked the blankets off himself before hopping out of bed, clad only in his holy G-string he sleeps in each night.

Mylo, hiding in a shadow in the corner gasped and clamped her hand over her mouth quickly.

Frain whirled around and narrowed his eyes, looking for the source of the noise. After a moment he shrugged and walked over to the full body mirror. He stretched and raised his arms, turning side to side and flexing. “Hey good looking, is it hot in here or you just on fire with Kossuth’s will?” Frain said to himself in the mirror. “No… That is stupid, Stupid Frain you’ll never win new converts over that way!”

Mylo rolled her eyes as she pulled out one of several water balloons, which she kept prepared, and tossed it as hard as she could at Frain’s back.

Frain was suddenly soaked with water, and he raised his eyebrows before turning around to see Mylo there, who dropped to the floor and rolled around laughing after seeing his face. His body began to steam with his gift of fire, the water burning off.

Tzaad could not help but thank Her that he fared better this night than last time. He was able to rig up a hammock between a few stairway rails to stay off the pillow floor and slept well. He looked up at the sign and read “Dry Cleaner” out loud to himself, before knocking on the closed window. His fist only met the squishy material of a pillow, and he scowled before simple knocked it down and yelling inside. “Hey, where’s my clothes, servants?!”

A translucent servant hurried forward, holding out a bundle to Tzaad. “As requested, young master, lightly starched!” 

Tzaad took the bundle and harrumphed before nodding and getting dressed, then headed towards the buffet. He sniffed himself, noticing the light scent of lavender and shook his head.

Steph opened her eyes, glad for another night of peaceful meditation with Waffle snoring gently by her side. She stood and slipped more than walked off the mounted of pillows she had situated herself upon and grabbed her cloak by the door. She slipped it on, checking many of her many pockets for a few things she knew she would need sooner rather than later. Satisfied, she nodded to herself and smiled, then headed out towards the buffet, Waffle having roused and following at her heels, lumbering head and shoulders on all fours taller than Steph.

Dom awoke feeling more refreshed than he had in a long time. He smiled. Was this… the promise of happiness? He could not remember the last time he felt this way. Not since he last saw Bea.  He hopped out, feeling like he wanted to go talk to his… friend, yeah, friend, Frain. Heading out into the hallway, he practically skipped over to Frain’s room, whistling to himself, and threw the door open. 

On the floor was Mylo, rolling around, Frain standing a few feet away, soaking wet and steaming while wearing nothing but a G-string.

Dom paused for a moment and stopped whistling. Frain looked over at him. Dom shook his head and said, “Nope, nope…” He looked at Frain again, “Nope”. Dom closed the door without saying anything else and headed to the buffet, whistling once more, scrubbing that sight from his memory.

Dom grabbed Manu on his way up to the front and walked into the foyer to find most of the soldiers, clerics, and the rest of his friends gathered in groups, eating from the lavender themed brunch buffet.

Steph caught sight of Dom and beckoned him over. “Okay”, Steph began, speaking to Tzaad, Dom, Manu, Frain, and Mylo. “So, we need to get all the Fifth company out to Faerie in Queen Mab’s domain at Arctis Tor. I was thinking Frain, you can take most of our core group, and Dom can recall the rest plus a few of the soldiers and clerics”

Frain and Dom nodded in unison. “I can call Mab to let her know too!” Frain chimed in, holding up his watch and tapping on it a few times.

A static noise whined from the watch before Queen Mab’s voice emanated from it. “Hello?”

“Hey!” Frain replied eagerly up into the air.

“Down here… Look at your watch!” Mab called, exasperated.

“Oh right!” Frain chirped, looking down at the watch. “Okay, we have recovered all the soldiers and are planning to head back, can you be ready for like, 60 people?”

“Of course, I’ll have it prepared before they get here, I’ll make it a little easier on you as well.” Queen Mab replied, before raising her right hand and snapping her fingers. There was a loud pop and Mylo disappeared, reappearing next to Queen Mab back in her office at Arctis Tor. “I’ve recalled my mortal champion, giving you one more spot for your teleportation. I’ll be awaiting your arrival” Queen Mab continued before shutting off communication.

Horst, the cleric, lumbered over to them, followed by the lithe Lt. Mal Rey. Horst spoke in a booming voice, “So, me and my clerics can get most of us to the material plane, but we would need a rendezvous to bring us to wherever our final destination is, as I’m sure you have one in mind”

“We do, actually!” Steph replied, holding up her finger. “We will be bringing you to Arctis Tor in Faerie, Queen Mab is our ally and we have much to discuss about the state of the world and how we need your help to take down the Illithid enslaving everyone, like those civilians. We can only take a few of you with us directly there though”

Nodding, Mal chimed in, “That’s certainly a lot to absorb at once, so we’ll discuss it later, for now we should get moving. You can take my second in command, Lira, along with a contingent of civilian children in bad shape for some immediate help”. Mal spoke matter of factly with an air of command he was clearly used to holding over others.

Tzaad stepped forward and saluted, “Excellent plan sir! We will execute it flawlessly!”

“No need to shout son, I’m right here… At ease”, Mal replied, smiling.

Tzaad nodded and deflated a bit.

“Alright, well let’s get started…” Dom said.

Lira walked over, a short and stout female elf, he left ear ragged along the top, as if it were torn off and a slight limp. “Sir, the children as requested” She barked.

Dom smiled and held out his hand to the nearest child, who reluctantly took it. Eventually everyone had linked hands with Dom and Frain.

“I wrote the coordinate for you to wait at in the material plane on the paper I gave you,” Steph explained.

 Lt. Mal nodded saluted them before they popped out of existence. Frain had tapped his tuning fork and matched frequencies with the fortress of Arctis Tor. Dom crackled with lightning, attuning to his offering to Zeus. Frain and his contingent, appeared in the small room they first appear in Arctis Tor a while back. Dom and his group, including Lira, appeared back in the non-denominational church at his altar to Zeus. Dom looked down and saw the note he had left his parents was gone and smiled to himself. 

Mal, Horst, and the rest of the soldier, clerics, and civilians gathered and left in small groups to the coordinates of the mountaintop given to them by Steph.

Frain and the others headed out into the main office, heading across the bustling office floor without much issue.

Dom led his group through the tight hallways until they came to the main office. He looked across and saw Frain. Dom raised his hand and stopped short of calling out when he also caught site of Karen in the middle, talking to a distressed looking dwarf. 

“Oh crap”, Dom whispered, before slipping behind Lira and crouching down.

Within moments, Karen had caught sight of them in turn and hurried over. “OOOOOOOOOH MYYYY, how wonderful, new friends! Welcome!”

Dom sighed, and saw Frain hurrying over to help.

“Oh, hey, Karen, could you, uh, make some copies of this flyer of Kossuth for me, I need 1000”, Frain asked, thinking quickly.

Karen didn’t miss a beat and replied, “Of course, but I’ll have to charge it to your account! I could use some helpsie welpsies though!” She eyed Dom, who cowered further and pushed Lira towards her.

“Oh my, a volunteer! Great, come with me!” Karen proclaimed, grabbing Lira by the arm, who was speechless and confused, and hurried off with her.

Frain made a half hearted attempted to save Lira but missed her arm and shook his head as they disappeared around a corner to the copier room.

“Nightmare avoided…” Dom sighed.

They all headed up the elevator to the war room and were met with the sight of Queen Mab with her hands on the edge of the war table, looking down on the world map. She looked up as they entered, he eyes shifting from glacier blue to snow white, her snow-white hair pulled back in her signature power bun, showing off he long pointed ears accented by her icicle earrings.

“Great, now that you’re all here, we can catch up on my end. Mylo has already filled me in on your time for the most part, so I can just get straight to the point.” Queen Mab began and held up her hand, a small remote in her palm. “Firstly, we were able to reverse engineer one remote control for the mind control implants from a small amount of materials that Mylo here had recovered from her earlier mission to the Northern Mountains.” The remote had a small speaker on the bottom, with 4 big buttons reading, “Command, Cripple, Kill, and Release”. “Now, I suggest you retire to the west towers and your sleeping quarters. Your college Celestial is there and has been busy while you are gone, she can fill you in when you get there.”

Tzaad held up his finger and opened his mouth but couldn’t think of anything to say. Queen Mav looked at him expectantly. Tzaad curled his finger and started to sweat. “I… Uh… Need to go to the bathroom.”

Mab raised one eyebrow, “There should be one in your quarters. Is that all?”

Tzaad lowered his arm slowly and then lowered his head, “Yes…”

“Great, come back to me when you have a further plan for the assault on the southern stronghold. This is the end game, so get your heads in it.” Queen Mab said definitively, turning back to the table.

Mylo looked at everyone and pointed her chin at the elevator and headed out with everyone. Eventually they made it to the freight elevator and got in, beginning their short trip upwards to another level of the fortress.

Tzaad. Nodding his head to ever unheard music, let the sexy sax flow from his mind out into the ambiance of the elevator, the smoothness of the jazzy tunes flowing from Hard Pass and washing over everyone else. Eventually every head was bobbing, and several feet were tapping. The elevator came to a stop, and the mood, along with the music, stopped just as suddenly, and they stepped out and continued to the quarters.

Ahead, waiting at the end of the glass hall overlooking the snowy wasteland of the world beyond the fortress was Celestial, who smiled and waved.

“Friends, welcome back!” Celestial called out in her lilting, Eastern Isles accent.

At her side was a familiar sight of Bartholomew, her cat companion as well as elected King of Cats.

 “There is a lot to talk about. Thankfully Mylo filled me in with Mab on your adventures. Crazy stuff!” Celestial proclaimed. 

“Yeah, it was. And it’s great to see you!” Tzaad said, smiling.

“Yes!” Steph squeaked.

Celestial smiled and nodded. “I’ll get some of the big stuff out of the way quickly.”

At that moment, another cat wander from behind her and sat at her right side. He had white paw and a thick black coat.

“Is that… Asparagus?” Frain asked, confused. “I thought he was dead.”

“I… am not dead of course.” Asparagus Whitesocks responded in his haughty oxford accent.

Bartholomew stepped forward and spoke in his commanding voice, “He was instrumental in our extraction of Theodore Rumplebutt, Celestial’s brothers. Celestial here led an effort on intel Asparagus had on the order to extract, and it was successful. We decided to spare him and consider his debt repaid.”

Celestial nodded. “This is true, I’m glad to have him back but he is in a bad way. He is… detoxing in a separate wing of the castle. His brainwashing was deep and… complete. He seems to have lot some of who he was, and suddenly being cut off from the source was… like cutting off a drug addict.” Celestial looked away, wiping away a few tears.

She continued, “His husband Michael is with him. Also, Murder and Saline have decided to help, infiltrating the order as acolytes for now, feeding us happenings on the activity of recruits. Every bit helps and we hope to get them out in a matter of weeks before they are initiated.” 

“Wow, you were definitely busy” Tzaad replied, raising his eyebrows, smiling a bit, and raising both thumbs. “Me likey”.
