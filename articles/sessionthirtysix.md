Tzaad slapped himself in the face and shook his head. “I’m… sorry, I was feeling a bit out of it. I think I am better now… Where were we?”

Steph side eyed him and reached behind her, straining a bit as she tried to fish out some paper poking out of a pocket in her Robe of Many Pockets near the mid-section of her back. After a few awkward seconds of nobody offering help, she was able to just grab the tip of the pages and pulled them out, letting out a long sigh of relief. She shook them out and uncreased them on her thigh before holding them up.

“Okay, I have some notes here that I’ve accumulated over our travels. I think we should huddle and go over who we might want to call upon for the final battle.” Steph explained, running her eyes over the first page, turning it over and back.

“So uh, other than the cats and Celestial here, who else are we looking at?” Dom asked.

“Ooh, ooh, me first!” Tzaad interjected. “The dragon… Uh… Tesseract was his name I think?”

“Yeah, that was it” Frain replied. “We can use the sapphire he gave us to call him!” Frain continued, pulling it out of a pocket of his robes, turning it over as it sparkled in the soft light of the hall. He put it away and looked up, “What about the Dame of Dirt?”

“Yeah… I don’t think she’s happy with us.” Tzaad said.

“Does she know we swindled her or something? We could just be… taking our time?” Dom offered.

Frain shook his head and turned to Bartholemew, the King of Cats and asked, “What do you know of the Dame of Dirt? Think we can get her help?”

Bartholemew, a large, majestic looking cat, with dark fur, and large, opalescent eyes jerked mid lick of his paw and looked up. He narrowed his eyes. “She is one of our arch nemeses, I can tell you as much” Bartholemew began with his booming, regal voice.

Bartholemew stalked over to a nearby end table next to one of the doors set in the wall of the circular hallways of the tower they stood in. He hopped up, sitting precariously next to a vase with a flower in it that took up most of the space on the table, and lick his paw before running it over his ear and eyed the vase.

Frain raised his hand towards Bartholemew, and he said, “Whoa, watch out for the vase”

Bartholemew’s ears twitched and he looked at the vase. “Oh… this?” he asked, raising his paw and setting it gently on the vase.

“Ye… Yeah. You’re going to knock it…” Frain began, but was cut off by the distinct sound of crashing glass and splashing water.

Bartholemew sat on the table, the vase no longer next to him. His tail flicked and he jumped down prowling around, playing with lint on the floor and continued, “The Dame of Dirt controls the underground of the cities in the Forgotten Star, our world. Our worst enemies are her greatest allies… Rats.”

“I feel you”, Tzaad chimed in, nodding his head.

Steph shook her head, “Okay, but… Can the rats help us?”

She looked around, having lost track of Bartholemew before spotting him at another table further down the circular hallways, paw on the vase on that table.

“Rats can help no one! They are a menace, a pestilence upon this world! Cats are faster, smarter, larger than rats. We are superior in every way! Bartholemew belted out passionately, flicking his wrist and sending the vase to the ground with another crash.

Frain cringed,” Will you stop doing that…”

Steph’s eye twitched and she turned back to the others, “Okey dokey, moving on…” she said, looking down at her notes. “I have Sereia the mermaid here, of the Coral Court!”

“Yes! We saved her at the carnival and met up with her again in the Summer Court… Those were good times.” Tzaad added, eyes twinkling.

Frain held up his finger. “We also have the Erlking of the Wild Hunt… We uh, connected I think” Frain said, flashing back to the Erlking asking to be dominated by Frain, and he shuddered.

Steph wrote something into her notes before replying, “I’m not sure we can involve the Fae directly in the mortal world.”

Frain shrugged, “Can’t hurt to ask.”

Steph nodded and wrote something else down. “What about the dwarves of the Church of Kossuth?” Steph asked Frain.

Frain nodded and looked over at Dom, locking eyes with him before they smiled and said in unison, “A crusade is it?!”

Dom laughed with Frain, eyes twinkling. 

Frain turned back to Steph and replied, “There will probably be a lot of flames, and innocent bystanders. I’m not responsible for their actions.”

Steph rolled her eyes and continued writing down notes. “I assume we have the filthy five after helping them out?”

Tzaad stepped forward, “I’m sure! Lt. Mal is a good man… despite his taste in women.”

Dom spoke up, “How about anyone from the library? I know Murder and Saline are out and undercover, but maybe Atrophy, the Page Knight?”

“Maybe we can send someone to get them…” Tzaad recommended.

Dom nodded and continued, “Yeah we’ll have to figure something out. How about Jim and Abel?”

“Well… I did kill Jim once” Tzaad replied abashed.

“Then we healed him!” Frain retorted.

“True.” Tzaad said, shrugging.

Steph scribbled some more notes and spoke again, “Featherwind and her people then?”

“We don’t need her!” Tzaad cut in quickly.

Steph chuckled, “We can’t afford to be picky… Anyways, how about Giggle the orc centaur from the library?”

“Him and all 6 nipple piercings!?” Dom proclaimed.

Tzaad started counting on his fingers.

Steph replied, “Yeah all of them.”

Steph turned back towards where Bartholemew was asked, “Can you send cats to delivers our messages and invitations…” She trailed off, not see him.

They heard another crash and splash, and Bartholemew came trotting around the rounded corner before sitting down in front of them and licking his paw, running it across his ear again.

“I swear by the fire…” Frain began.

Bartholemew cut him off, “My influence is great. My reign and our Congress of Cats extends into every corner of the world that cats would exist!”

“Whoa, how many cats do you think that is, in like, square meters…?” Tzaad asked.

“Lots of cats!” Bartholemew boomed. “At least 1 cat every hundred meters!”

Waffle the winter wolf, standing head and shoulders taller than Frain, padded over to Bartholemew, and snooted him, interested in the flowers and water smell. Waffles snoots scooted Bartholemew around the carpet before He yowled and bounded across the hall to get away.

“Enough of that, beast!” Bartholemew called out, licking himself more vigorously to get the smell off.

Steph walked over to Waffle, scratching her ears, and asked, “Can you convene the Congress of Cats to gather everyone we mention?”

Celestial spoke up at this point, in her lilting Eastern Isles accent, “I think this all makes sense, however we should probably have a solid plan to bring back to Queen Mab, the Winter Faerie Queen, before we gather all allies.” 

Tzaad’s eyes lit up, “Ooh, maybe we have an army attack the front and send a small force in the back to destroy the crystals from within!”

“Well… planning wars isn’t my strength.” Steph replied.

Dom spoke up, “Maybe we should know what we’re up against. What’s in the stronghold? Can we scout it? Are there any cats in there?”

“Just abominations. None under my influence. Monstrous things twisted by the mental energies of the monsters that live there. The Others.” Bartholemew whispered, shuddering.

Mylo stepped forward, “I’m sneaky! I can infiltrate and scout!”

Steph nodded, “That sounds great!”

A sudden wave of nausea ran over Steph, Dom, Frain, and Mylo, and Tzaad. They all had to roll constitution saving throws. 

Steph, Dom, Mylo, and Frain passed out immediately, tumbling to the floor. Tzaad fell to one knee, clutching his stomach, his eyes blurring. He looked up to see Celestial running up to him, and grabbing him by the shoulder, mouthing something with a panicked look in her eyes. It looked almost like she was saying… “Impossible”. Tzaad slumped forward, unconscious.

Mylo felt herself on soft ground and felt the dappling of sunlight on her face. She sat up suddenly and smacked her forehead on something hard.

“YOWTCH!” cried a man, who fell on his backside, rubbing his forehead.

Mylo fells back before springing to her feet again, opening her eyes and twisting around to face the man, pulled a knife from the middle of her leather tunic, eyes narrowing. “Identify yourself before something bad happens…”

“Whoa! Hang on!” The man cried in a thick Jersey Hill accent, holding up her hands and scrambling to his feet to join two others standing nearby. “It’s me… remember?”

“I… can’t say I do…” Mylo replied.

“Wha… You threatened to kill us, just like right now. We had a whole thing! You don’t…” Sauly D. sputtered, frantic. He stopped and took a deep breath.

“Where are we anyways?” Mylo asked, looking around at the canopy of trees and the dirt path beneath her.

“This is Jersey Hill.” Dom replied. “You know, I don’t actually know where Jersey Hill is to be honest… Where is it?” He asked Sauly D.

“It’s an island, in the east ocean… How are you getting somewhere when you don’t know where it is?!” Sauly D. replied, incredulous.

Dom shrugged and stretched, “It’s a long story.”

“What are you doing here anyways?” Tzaad asked them.

“Who us?” Sauly D. asked, looking at Sookie and Guidolo. “We’re on patrol. We joined the guard!”

“The racist one?” Frain asked.

“Uh... Well, look we don’t get into politics… Uh…” Sauly D. trailed off. “Looks that’s not important! We have been tasked with watching the area. Lots of people have gone missing around here!”

“Oh yeah? Where?” Tzaad asked.

“Well, mostly by the Allano rothe farm”, Sookie replied, staring at her nails, chewing on something nobody could quite make out. “Actually, while you’re here, think you can help us out?”

Tzaad shrugged and pointed his chin down the road. “Might as well since we’re here. You lead the way you scoundrels.”

Sauly D. whisper something to Guidolo before he started down the path. “Alright, but it’s a gruesome sight.”

After a few miles they turned a corner and were greeted with a large expanse of field with a farmhouse, a few barns, some outhouses, and dozens of furry lumps littering the ground around the tilled fields.

“What are those?” Mylo asked, squinting her eyes.

A voice behind them answered, coming out of the bushes. “Those are rothe, beasts of burden much like Ox. They all dropped dead within a few days of each other!” The voice came from an elven woman dressed in scholars’ robes, a scroll dangling from her belt and a quill in her hand, her graying hair pulled up in a loose bun on top of her head. 

Steph jumped and turned, her hands held out ready to karate chop enemies, “Who are you!?”

“I am Lady Innedra.” The elf replied calmly. “I recently heard that an elf who worked on this farm was investigating the fey’ri, elves who consorted with demons and devils a long time ago. I also believe there used to be a fey’ri outpost around here in ancient times. I’m here to investigate on behalf on my college, to learn as much as I can. But I found this scene and have just been observing for the past few days.”

Tzaad recognized the fey’ri name, having a wide knowledge of demons and devils himself from his time in the Hellriders. “Okay, so do you think that has something to do with the devastation here?” Tzaad asked.

“I have no idea, but if you can relay anything you find out, I’d greatly appreciate it! I can pay you, and lead you to where I’ve seen someone entering yesterday!” Lady Innedra replied.

Mylo stepped forward, nodding, “It would be our pleasure to get to the bottom of this, no payment needed.”

“Whoa there, let’s not be so hasty…” Steph interjected. “We get hungry, we need money too. We’ll gladly be paid, lady!”

Dom looked over, noticed the Jersey Hill boys and girl inching away. “Hang on there!” Dom called out, and they froze. “Where do you think you are going?”

Guidolo scratched the back of his head, grinning nervously, “Well, you see, you obviously don’t need us anymore, and this place gives us the creeps…”

“Nuh uh, you stay right here until we get back to slimy bastards” Tzaad demanded, pointing at their feet. 

“Okay, okay, we’ll stay here, no problem!” Sauly D replied, saluting.

“Lead the way, Lady Innedra”, Tzaad said, turning to the elf.

Lady Innedra nodded and led them to the furthest barn out, passing close to some of the fallen rothe on the ground, their corpses stinking of decay. She pointed out some scruff marks on the ground and pointing at a trap door. “There, he must have gone in there!”

Dom investigated and was able to discern that bodies had been dragged through here. He opened the trap door and examined the darkness before using light on a nearby pebble and tossing it down. It fell for a few seconds before squishing on something he could not make out. “I don’t like the look of this…”

“I’ll go first”, Mylo said, swinging down on to the ladder and beginning to descend.

The rest of the party followed. Frain went last, casting scrying on Lady Innedra before going down. Mylo reached the bottom and hopped down, splashing in something. The smell of iron filling her nose.

“Oh no… This is blood”, she said to the others, who gasped, squishing down next to her.

“Looks like there are some tracks down the passage, let’s go” Mylo continued, and then walked ahead.

Waffle floated down on a feather fall from Steph after them.

Mylo came out after a few miles into a large, well lit room, tiled on the floor, with 6 statues in twos rows of three facing each other, seeming to make a hallway towards a door in the far wall. There were 3 unique statues on one side, mirrored with identical statues opposite them.

Steph look around before finding a message scrawled on the ground in front of the entrance between the statues. It was written in some language they did not know. Written next to it in common she read out, “To pass you must speak the titles of each of the three, divided by three: TLLHOAERDSDYLVAAEGYNOEONRMY”.

“Uh guys, I have no idea what this means.” Tzaad declared.

“Gee thanks for the help, let me think…” Steph retorted, scrunching her face in thought.

Dom was muttering to himself before blurting out, “Lady Agony!”

The third row of statues crossed their swords and seemed to step back at the name.

“That’s it! Every third letter put together form names!” Dom explained.

They worked out the rest and said out loud, “The Slayer, and Lord Venom.”

The remaining statues stood back similarly, moving from actively menacing positions to more passive. The door at the end of their makeshift hallway clicked open.

“We got that bloody well right!” Dom proclaimed.
