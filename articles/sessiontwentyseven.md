Shaking off her initial nausea and shock, Steph heard rattling and looking up. On the throne ahead of her, the skull was floating into the air and glowing with a menacing red light, rattling its jaw. The three diamonds shone with the red light, looking as though the skull was casting its gaze on her. Tzaad let out a bellow and charged ahead of the group at the throne, delivery a flurry of slashes which ended up as glancing blows.

“Uh guys, I think this might be harder to kill than it looks”, Tzaad called out.

“No problem!” Frain gleefully exclaimed, casting Guardian Spirit near the throne, dealing massive radiant damage.

Steph and Waffle worked as a team, Steph blasting the demi-lich with a cone of ice, and Waffle following up with a Frost Breath, each dealing massive damage and slowing it.

Dom followed with a well-placed guiding bolt.

The demi-lich hit back hard with a life drain, restoring most of its health surprising everyone, and letting out an ear-splitting wail that immediately downs Celestial and Frain.

Waffle ran over quickly and gave Frain some much need puppy licks, stabilizing him. Frain got to his feet and roared out a Fireball, fizzling on impact.

Chuckling, Steph stepped forward, “Let me show you how it’s done!” she bellowed, letting loose her own Fireball that dealt massive damage.

“Well I could’ve done that if I wanted to…” Frain muttered, kicking the floor.

Celestial struggled to her feet and cast a mass cure wounds, stabilizing everyone again for another push. Dom used the extra strength to throw a final guiding bolt, felling the demi-lich, and he roared in triumph.

Waffle side-eyed Frain, letting him know she saved his ass, and Frain chuckled, “Thanks.”

Tzaad walked over to the remains of the demi-lich, which had disintegrated and rooted around. The 3 diamonds had turned to dust, but he was able to scoop them into a pouch.

Clapping her hands, Steph turned back to the throne, “Alright, let’s get what we came…” she trailed off as she saw a figure next to the throne.

The figure was the cloaked Tesseract, who had appeared to have picked up the book in front of the throne and was reading it!

“Hey, you weren’t the skull?!” Dom asked, perturbed.

“No, I’m afraid not… The skull was an old lich named Acererak, and this his is lair. The book was placed here in this den of evil to repel me.” Tesseract replied.

“Who are YOU then?” Steph demanded.

Tesseract sighed and turned towards the group, reaching up and pulling off the cow’s skull mask. Underneath revealed a golden draconic face. Everyone looked at him blankly.

“You may have never run into one of my kind, and for good reason. I am a golden dragon, the last of my kind in fact… You see, this book holds the secrets to the creation of the mind control device the others use”, Tesseract explains.

“Well we don’t want to use it for evil, we want to use it to defeat the others!” Frain explained.

“To give you this book is to give you power over my life. You see they harvested my kind for our parts… Bones, hide, teeth, blood, all components of the intricate machinery they built and maintain. The schematics are all in here.” Tesseract countered.

“Look, we came a long way for this, and we need it to defeat the others once and for all, rid our planet of them! We can help you help us!” Frain pleaded.

Tesseract was silent for a moment before looking down at the book and back at Frain. “I would be trusting you with my life. I have watching to rid these places of evil, so I’m inclined to believe you…” Tesseract walked over to Frain and looked down at him before slowly extending the book to him.

Frain reached out and took the book gingerly, nodding with a solemn expression. “We’ll guard it with our lives.”

Tzaad had wandered away from the conversation and over to the throne, “That’s cool, but guys look at this! It’s a chest full of stuff!”

Everyone wandered over and looked. When all was split, they had found a star sapphire, star ruby, star opal, portion of storm giant strength, 10000 gold, a bag of beans, and an onyx ring of ritual. The onyx ring had 3 charges, that could be used once per day, where they could cast any spell as a ritual with a successful roll of 10 or more. On a failed roll, the ring has a chance of breaking.

Frain looked back at Tesseract, “Hey Tessy, can I call you Tessy?”

“No”, Tesseract replied solemnly.

“Okay, well, thank you for trusting us with this. We do seem to have another problem, and that is a way out of this infernal library. Could you help us?” Frain inquired.

Tesseract nodded, “Of course, we can head back, and I will escort you out.” 

Everyone followed as they made their way back out of the maze of this cursed place and made it back into the forest of books to find Giggle the orc centaur outside watching the entrance nervously. When he saw them exit his eyes lit up and he smiled.

“You made it! I figured you must have as I sensed the evil had dissipated and I could approach the entrance! Did you find what you came for?”, Giggle asked in one breath.

“Yeah, we got it. Where are murder and Saline?” Steph asked.

“Ah, they are waiting where we left them last, by the entrance to the forest. I’ll take you now!” Giggle replied, and turned, cantering away as they followed.

After an hour or so they came back to a clearing where Murder, Saline, and Stellar (the gnome) waiting, looking very bored, Saline resting her head on Murder’s shoulder.

Murder grimaced when she saw the group emerge, “It took you long enough, I thought I’d die of old age before we got out of here.”

“Well nice to see you too, Murder”, Tzaad replied with a blank expression.

“As riveting as this reunion is, I suggest we move along”, Tesseract interjected. Tesseract turned and transformed into a gargantuan golden dragon in the blink of an eye it seemed, everyone looking on in awe. “Are you just going to stare or hop on?”

Closing their mouths, everyone quickly scrambled onto his back before Tesseract took flight, leaving the bookshelves below them and delving into the dark clouds above. Before entering the dark clouds they looked down to see The Librarian throwing an orangutan salute their way. 

After a minute or so they emerged above the clouds and hurtled to the hole in the ceiling that led to the small library room they had come down from in the glass elevator. Tesseract hovered just under the opening as they jumped up and pulled themselves back in. After everyone has dismounted Tesseract came through the opening himself, transforming into his smaller draconic form.

“Now I recommend waiting until nightfall, as beyond the veil there”, Tesseract began, pointing at the entrance to the spire, “It is daytime. Once I drop the barrier, we’ll have moments to get through before it seals itself again”.

“I guess we should rest then…” Steph suggested.

Everyone agreed and they settled into corners of the room, eating, and getting some sleep, Tzaad keeping an eye on Stellar with one eye open. After everyone woke up, they came up with a plan to drop off Stellar.

“I have a spell that can modify memory you know”, Steph explained.

“Sure, do that, whatever gets him off our hands”, Tzaad agreed.

“Okay, here we go…” Steph cracked her knuckles and summoned her floating spell book, casting modify memory from its magical fluttering pages.

Stellar looked dazed for a moment and then started looking around, “What… Who?”

Suddenly he was knocked out from behind by Celestial who shrugged at everyone’s shocked faces, “It doesn’t help to have him see us all again after just wiping his memory, right?”

“Alright we’ll leave him just outside the tower”, Frain said.

“Right, and he has to be de-pantsed. That’s important!” Tzaad chimed in.

Everyone just shook their heads and ignored him.

“Okay, shall we move on?” Tesseract asked. After consent he moved to the doorway and muttered under his breath, casting a spell they could not discern that removed the dark barrier from the doorway, revealing the streets of Haven beyond in front of the Scholar’s Spire.

 Everyone quickly made their way out, and Tzaad dropped Stellar off up against a wall of the spire, patting him on the head before turning away.

“Now what?” Tzaad asked.

“Well, I suppose we’ll be on our way”, Murder answered.

“Whoa, you cannot go out there all alone!” Celestial exclaimed.

Murder just shrugged, “We’ll find our way, I’ve never gotten help before…”

“That’s so Tzaad”, Tzaad said. “Here, you should have some gold at least to help!” He continued as he pulled out 500 gold pieces and handed it over.

“Wow, thanks!” Saline exclaimed looking at the pouch of gold. 

“Right, and somewhere to stay. Follow the signs to the Bards college and go to the blue apartment buildings to the right. My apartment is on the top floor, warded from magic.” Celestial explained, handing over her keys. “My friends will find you there and give you more guidance as well. Good luck!”

Murder and Saline nodded their thanks and made their way to Celestial’s apartment.

“I shall be on my way as well”, Tesseract said suddenly. “It’s best we don’t dally around here”.

“Wait, how do we contact you!” Tzaad asked.

“This is a sapphire attuned to my soul. Tap into it’s power and you can communicate with me once”, Tesseract explained, handing over a Sapphire of Tesseract to Tzaad.

Tzaad held it like a hot potato and gingerly handed it off to Steph after Tesseract left, “This is more your wizardly wheelhouse”.

“Thanks…?” Steph replied, taking the gem. She put it away and cast her Ward of Disinterest with a ritual. “To buy us some time to come up with a plan!”

“Alright, what do we have”, Frain began, pulling out the book and flipping through it.

Inside they learned the Polyhedron they touched all those months ago in initiation is the mind control booster. It is connected by the tattoos and powered by three large castle sized blue crystals located in their stronghold. The book also explained exactly how to make and operate the mind control devices out of golden dragon parts.

“Alright I think we need to regroup if we’re going to head to their stronghold, I’ll call Mab”, Frain said, with everyone nodding in agreement.

Frain pulled up his watch and tapped it a few times until there was a ringing noise. After a few rings, Queen Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness, picked up, pointed and severe face framed in the small watch window.

“Ah yes, there you are. What have you to report?” Queen Mab inquired.

“Hey so we got information on the Scholar’s Spire after talking to the Dame of Dirt, so we went in and retrieved a book. It has got secrets about making those mind control devices”, Frain explained. 

“And I got to ride a dragon!” Tzaad proclaimed into the watch.

Frain shot him a dirty look and continued, “So we think we should head back to regroup”.

“That’s a great idea. Please come back to the castle, just return to the mountaintop my elevator deposited you on. I have a few key pieces of information to share that I think you will all find extremely interesting”. Queen Mab explained, before hanging up.

“Alright, guess we’re heading back”, Dom said into the silence.
