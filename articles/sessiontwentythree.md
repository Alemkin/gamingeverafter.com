The Dame of Dirt stared at Dom for a few moments, “Right… Are yah goin’ then or wat?”

Dom jumped in surprise with his hands up in front of him, “Right! Sorry! Off we go!”

As Dom turned to the exit Steph held out her hand, “Hang on, we don’t really know how to get out of here”.

The Dame of Dirt nodded, “O’ course, head out here, take a right, go about 100 feet, then left, then your next right, then 2 more left, and finally a right, and 50 feet down is the door to the elevator that brought yah’ down”.

Tzaad’s jaw had gone slack and Steph cut it, “Okay, I think if someone could help us that would be great”.

Tzaad snapped out of his stupor, “Yes, that would be perfect!”

Dehbaaaatry limped over to the group, “I’ll help yah out”.

As Dehbaaaatry led the group out, Tzaad leaned over to Steph and whispered, “Oh man, we’re forcing the cripple to lead us out”.

Steph gave him a swift elbow to the ribs and hurried ahead. After several confusing twists and turns back the way they came then got to the elevator. Dehbaaaatry waggled him fingers in farewell with a smile missing more than a few teeth before pulling the lever that sent them on their way back up.

A few hundred feet and saxophone solos from Hard Pass later, the group was back in the open field. Everyone looks at each other for a few moments before breaking into a breakneck skip down the deserted mid night road, arms links, grins plastered on their dumb faces.

After a few minutes of this, Milo was too sneaky to be noticed by everyone and popped out of the shadows, slapping at the link between Frain’s dangling frame and Dom’s arm. Steph fell flat on her face, Dom rolling to the side, and Frain falling on his back, no longer supported by his comrades. Tzaad rolled a natural 1 and had a spectacularly long fall into the mud at the side of the road. Waffle and Celestial deftly regained their feet before falling.

After getting up and dusting herself off, Steph called out, “Milo, is that you?”

Milo grinned, “The one and only!”

“What are you doing here!?” Dom asked, flustered from his fall.

“I finished my last mission and I’m here to check up, where are you going?” Milo answered.

 Tzaad shrugged, “We’re getting a book or some shit, I don’t know”.

“Yeah, we’re going to retrieve a book and ring from the Scholar’s Spire!” Frain chimed in.

Milo nodded and smiled, “Cool, I’m in”

“Wow, you’re easy”, Dom quipped.

Frain led the way this time and decided the group should definitely not skip and walked normally the rest of the way to the spire. Approaching the spire in the dead of the night they noticed nothing out of the ordinary. There was a single door at the based of the smooth stone tower that seemed to reach into the sky endlessly.

“I’m going to sneak around and check it out, wait for me”, Tzaad said before quickly heading off.

Creeping around the back of the spire he found a small gnome examining a stone, the same as all the rest, on the spire. He didn’t notice Tzaad, and he snuck back to the group.

“So, there’s this gnome back there and he looked familiar, but it’s too dark to tell from a distance…” Tzaad explained. “So… Should we interrogate him?”

“Whoa, there’s no need to kill and torture someone for no reason!”, Steph exclaimed.

Tzaad held up his hands, “I never said torture and kill, what the hell…”

Celestial giggled, “I feel like you did, that’s what I heard anyways. We are a group of baby killers after all.”

“Well, just one and it’s Tzaad”, Steph said quickly.

“I swear to Her!” Tzaad began.

Steph held up her hand cutting him off grinning, “No, it’s sad that there is only one!”

“Zing!” Dom hooted.

“Oh you son of a…” Tzaad said, chuckling in admiration of Steph’s masterful zinger. 

“Okay guys, I’m just going to try the door”, Frain said walking up to the tower and reaching for the handle.

Frain grabbed the handle and turned. As he touched it he felt the sensation telling him that the metal was searing hot, hot enough to melt skin, but luckily he happened to be the one with fire resistance, thank Kossuth… He pulled and the door swung up revealing an impenetrable blackness, almost like an ethereal barrier encompassed the entrance they could not see beyond.

“Hey guys, look!”, Frain called back.

Everyone gathered near and examined the entrance. Steph used her magical investigations and could tell the barrier was magical in nature.

“Alright, maybe we should go get that gnome”, Milo said suddenly.

The rest of the group agreed and Tzaad and Milo headed off together around the back of the tower. Milo came up behind the gnome and pinned him, Tzaad coming up quick and gagging him. They brought him back around to the group.

Steph stepped forward and pulled up the gnome’s sleeves checking for tattoos. He struck a distinctive figure, wearing a formal suit, a monocle, and missing his left ear.

“This guy looks familiar… Wait is that Stellar?” Steph realized out loud.

The others nodded, Frain chiming in, “Yep, that’s him, Stellar Oilpot!”

Stellar’s eyes were wild with fear, darting around at everyone.

“Look, we’re not good at meeting new people, so please bear with us. I’m going to ungag you and we’re going to ask some question”, Dom explained, reaching out and removing the gag.

“Help, help!” Stellar began calling out began coughs.

Dom put the gag back quickly, “Hey, stop that!”

“Okay, maybe he has a tattoo somewhere else, I’m just going to check really quick”, Tzaad said, reaching out with trembling fingers towards Stellar’s pants.

Stellar’s eyes widened when he realized what was happening and began to struggle. Frain and Dom looked at each other uncomfortably and shrugged. Tzaad slowly pulled down Stellar’s pants and examined… He slowly put the pants back on to everyone’s relief.

“Looks good!” Tzaad said, straightening up.

Steph shook her head and spoke to Stellar, “Look I’ll ungag you, just don’t scream okay?”

Stellar nodded vigorously and Steph ungagged him, and he coughed out, “Okay, just don’t sexually assault me again, please!”

“Now, what are you doing here?”, Steph asked.

Stellar replied, “I’m investigating the tower for the order of course! I bring samples back to my lab, but I haven’t heard much. Everyone who goes in doesn’t come back out, so I’m limited to this research…” He trailed off as he got a good look at Tzaad. “Wait… Aren’t you wanted for killing a baby?”

Tzaad moved swiftly behind him and put him into a chokehold. The others watched like silent sociopaths for about thirty seconds as Stellar was put to sleep.

“He was answering us!” Steph said sternly.

“We were not learning anything anyways”, Tzaad grunted as the others just stared at him. “Help me with this Frain”, Tzaad continued as he picked up the Stellar and began stuffing him into his pack, with Frain stepping forward reluctantly and helping him fold.

“Oy, what are you doin’ over there!?” a familiar cockney voice called out from behind them.

Turned back they recognized the profile of Jim Bulge. More guards began to run up behind him, an alarm beginning to sound.

“Oh crap, run!” Frain cried out, sprinting for the tower.

Everyone jumped through the entrance to the tower, all sound from outside cutting off as they crossed the threshold. Inside was a small square room with the walls lined with bookshelves from floor to a ceiling about 20 feet up, heavy with books. In the center of the room was what looked to be an all glass elevator. Tzaad looked around in wonder and set down his pack, readjusting the unconscious Stellar before hauling it back up.

Dom walked up to the shelf nearest him and picked out a book at random, reading the title, “Treacherous Journals from Jersey Hill”. Dom put the book back swiftly, “Nope nothing here, let’s go …”

“Hang on, I want to see!”, Tzaad said, walking to another book and pulling it down reading the title, “My Lord's Serpent. On the topic of Unspeakable Damnation”. “Well that’s interesting”, Tzaad muttered and turned to the next page with a single sentence on it, “Unauthorized readers will be punished”. Tzaad closed the book and gingerly put it back on the shelf.

“My turn!” Steph said excitedly, running over to the shelves and pulling a book down, the title reading, “Wish It, Want It, Screw It' - detailed accounts of times the Wish spell backfired Horribly”. Steph shrugged and put the book back.

Frain was in the elevator beckoning to the others, “Are we going down or what? It doesn’t look like the book we want is here!”

The others shrugged and piled onto the elevator. Once they were all in they pressing the down button and heard a booming metallic voice, “Welcome to THE ELEVATOR! Maintain proper elevator safety procedures while you are within the premises!”

“Whoa, it talks!” Frain exclaimed.

The elevator began to descend and there was darkness for a minute before they suddenly shot out into a vast empty darkness that seemed to go on forever with a slight illumination. Below was a dark cloud covering all below. Steph immediately hugged waffle, taken aback by the hundreds of feet separating them from the dark cloud in this clear glass elevator with no clear mechanism driving or securing it.

Several minutes of this and they descended into the dark cloud and came out on the other side in the middle of two towering bookcases, 50 feet high on either side, creating a corridor heading forwards and backwards from where the elevator touched down.

Stepping out Dom looked around, “Huh, weird…”

 Tzaad stepped out and heard something from the bookshelf to his left, “Hey psst, pick me up, read me!” it whispered.

He looked around confused and walked over to the bookshelf, pulling out a book. In big foil letters on the front of the book was, “Golden Examinations of Moving Silently: A Warriors Guide to Ultimate Stealth”.

“Oh, fuck yeah!” Tzaad proclaimed, opening it up. As he did, a puff of dust hit him in the face. Sputtering and coughing he wiped it away quickly, dropping the book. Suddenly he felt a searing pain in his neck that subsided after a few moments.

Steph stared at the spot with wide eyes.

“What is it?” Tzaad asked, concerned. 

“Your neck, there’s a tattoo…” Steph said.

“A tattoo of what!?” Tzaad asked.

“It says, ‘Not a baby killer’”, Frain chimed in, examining his neck.

“Honestly it just makes me thing you are a baby killer, denying it and all”, Celestial chimed in.

Grumbling, Tzaad covered it up with a scarf. “Just what I needed…”

Tzaad looked down at the book and pulled out his sword, chopping it up in a fury. As he did this they all heard a scream in the distance behind them.

Everyone looked in that direction, quieting. They all looked at each other and nodded.

“Towards the scream then?” Dom asked.

“Towards the scream!” they all yelled in unison, starting to head that way.

Just then they noticed a movement on top of one of the bookshelves, a figure moving fast and climbing down, almost appearing in front of them. Standing there in front of them was an orangutan in a sweater vest, wearing round spectacles. 

“Ook”, the orangutan said.

Everyone looked at each other in confusion and back.

“Hang on, I can communicate telepathically with animals!” Milo exclaimed and turned her focus on the orangutan.

The orangutan said “Ook” and Milo was able to understand, “Hello, I am The Librarian, although some would call me an Orang-utan, Pongo pongo, native of the Bhangbhangduc. I would not recommend going towards the scream as many dangers lie within the Infinite as you will find out.”

Milo nodded and relayed this.

“You got all that from Ook!?” Dom asked, wiping his hand down his face in exasperation. “Okay, ask if he knows about the book!”

“He can understand you guys, you just can’t understand him”, Milo replied.

“Right, okay, do you know where this book about these Illithid would be, their weakness?” Dom asked The Librarian.

The Librarian thought for a moment and replied, “Eek”. Milo translated, “There are many books, but one as rare as that must be in the heart of the library. A perilous adventure indeed. Beware of Page Knights, for their existence is tied to that of a book, and for every book there is one. There are also many cultures and colonies that reside within the confines of this library as well”.

“Okay thanks!” Dom replied.

“Ook” The Librarian replied, translated by Milo as, “Of course. Remember that words have power, and if you ever need me or find yourself in dire trouble, I will be there, for I am, The Librarian!”

The Librarian raised his ape arms dramatically and swooped back, climbing swiftly up the bookshelves and running along the top disappeared into the distance.

Everyone looked on in wonder, having witnessed the hero they need, if not the one they deserve…
