I can not stress this enough, but there will be a lot of articles on our play sessions in D&D. Beyond that we play mostly on the PS4 and Nintendo Switch, and have played the following games, among others: Kingdom Hearts, Spiderman, Fallout 4, The Rocksteady Batman Trilogy, The Last of Us, The Wolf Among Us, Crpyt of the Necrodancer, and Stardew Valley.'}
